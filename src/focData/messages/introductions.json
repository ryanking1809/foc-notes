    "text": "Hi, I’m Brian. I’m a grad student working on Sketch-n-Sketch, a bimodal program editor that allows the programmer to edit their plain-text code _or_ to directly manipulate the program’s output and thereby trigger appropriate program updates. Our main target domain is programs that draw SVGs, because for manipulating graphical shapes there’s already a kind of “standard” mouse UI—think Inkscape or PowerPoint or Illustrator—and a first goal was to imitate the basic interactions of such a regular vector graphics editor, although using plain-text code as the underlying representation of the drawing rather than some hidden graphics-specific internal data structure. More broadly the goal is to figure out reasonable ways to back-propagate manipulations on the output into code transformations, and even more broadly the theme is exploring ways to add more direct manipulation interactions to the programming workflow (e.g. mouse manipulations on code as well as on output). Many of the techniques are not specific to SVG and we are looking at alternative domains.

    "text": "Hi Steve, hi everyone. I've been following many of you on Twitter for a good while now, and decided it was time to join the Slack group after <@UA8HY8R7B> mentioned it positively in his most recent Zells project log.   \n\nI've lived my entire life in central Alberta, Canada — currently building a house in a remote forest with no phone service and barely any internet.\n\nLife Story (Abridged): I taught myself 3D animation as a kid/teen, which led to a job with a small company in a nearby town that makes some very neat interactive learning media. Over the past decade, I've taught myself to code, and am now the main software dev at the company.\n\nCurrently, I'm working on a new suite of tools for our simulation-crafting artists. I want to give them a programming experience that's worthy of being called \"Victor-esq\", vaguely in the tradition of HyperCard and SmallTalk, loosely inspired by system-centric video games like Factorio or SimCity, with tools as rich and powerful as I'm used to from 3D animation. I'll be sharing progress after I've finished the divergent prototyping phase and start to converge on a specific approach.\n\nI'm also a huge experimental music nerd, so DM me if you want to talk about Max/MSP or Brian Current's \"Slanted Time\" or Godfried-Willem Raes.  \n  \nTwitter: <@UC2A2ARPT>  \nPortfolio: <http://spiralganglion.com|spiralganglion.com>",

Like [a reactive GUI](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVeIPKnQAL4&amp;feature=youtu.be>) and a [DSL designed for large-scale modelling called SPA](<http://github.com/nengo/nengo-spa>) with its own type system. It's made me want to make more tools, so I've been following the domain for a while and I'm looking to do a PhD related to it.\n\nTwitter: @voyageur_techno",

    "text": "Hey <@UC6997THT>, I’ve just read your “Life Goals 2018” blog post. Two paragraphs in, I was hooked. I worked at Apple seven years, quit two years ago, and I can relate to everything you write. I’m also in a finding phase, living off my Apple savings, still with enough runway so I’m exactly in that position where it’s comfortable enough to explore whatever, and not uncomfortable enough to get your ass kicked into action. On good days I’m trying to push some projects forward that I consider meaningful, on other days I’m in that “the planet’s going to shit” mood (climate change, politics, etc.) that’s not helping with anything.\n\nThen you write about cancer. Over the last few months, I’ve been spending many hours talking with a good friend once a week during his chemotherapy. We used to work at Apple together, so we talk about the company, technology in general, and the future — stuff we love talking about. Last week they told him they have to stop the chemotherapy, because his body is so weak that it would kill him before the cancer does. I feel like that’s life giving me the (index) finger so I pay attention, because life can give you the (middle) finger anytime.\n\nYou live in Japan? Well, where are we going to eat? I’m coming to Tokyo next Wednesday, staying for 10 days in Roppongi. Let’s meet for coffee or food!",

Ok, well, I made video games for 25+ years C64-&gt;PS3, worked on the Chrome GPU team at Google making WebGL, and stumbled on the Future of Coding podcast recently.\n\nI don't know if have anything to add but I am interested in the topic. I wrote a simple signal based visual programming system for a game I worked on. I worked with a visual programming system called \"Virtools\" in like 2004. I also got lucky and by chance got to visit Dynamicland last March. I would love to discuss all that stuff somewhere and learn more.",

So glad that I found a place with people that share my passion.\nHey <@UC2A2ARPT>, glad that you're also here.\n\nMy name is Vladimir and I live in Russia, currently in Saint Petersburg.\nI always loved programming languages and was curious about alternative ways to program.\n\nSome years ago I became fascinated by Bret Victor's ideas, especially his \"Future Programming\" and \"Seeing Spaces\" talks.\nThis realization that is not technology's fault that we don't have better tools, but just lack of culture, improper attitude -- it felt really striking.\nSo I wanted to contribute to development of this new culture somehow. Introduce this thinking into daily life.\n\nAs a full-time employee I had to work on my projects on weekends.\nI would love to do it full time. In order to get that I need to turn project into something commercial.\nSomething that makes people ready to pay to stop the pain of alternative.\n\nSo I tried to create a \"Seeing tool\" for debugging (not Seeing Space though). A tool that captures trace events for Erlang/OTP platform and visualizes them.\nMakes it easier to understand what's happening. Allows to skip the pain of reading hundreds of lines of text logs. It may save hundreds of working hours.\nI choosed Erlang/OTP first because underlying model of isolated processes and message passing is really easy to visualize and manipulate with.\nSecond because it provides powerful tracing API, that makes it very easy to start. And third: I already had experience working in production with Erlang and I loved it.\n\nI took a couple of months break and worked on Batiscaph project: <https://github.com/vladimir-vg/batiscaph>\nHere is the demo video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNr7o9eg4Ck>\n\nI got a working prototype, yet it's far from being useful in production.\nI realized that road to commercializing this project is really long, may take years.\nI stopped this project for now and thinking about shorter ways of bringing new thinking into daily life.\n\nCurrently I'm thinking about new medium for software and hypermedia (That's why I was reading <@UA8HY8R7B> zells logs: <https://github.com/zells/project/tree/master/log>).\nGot one exciting idea about it. Also it might be easily connected to something not programming related, something that people use in daily life, thus bigger market and maybe easier commercialization.",

    "text": "hi! I'm Mariano Guerra, Software Engineer (actually Information Systems Engineer but close) from Argentina, currently living in Stuttgart, I like Distributed Systems, Swarm Intelligence/Emergent Systems and more specific to this group, creating programming languages, I created \"standard\" ones like efene[1] and more visual ones, two of them products that I developed and are my current source of income, the old one Event Fabric[2]: a data flow/scratch mix that ended up being more complex for customers to understand than what I expected. From the lessons learned from that one I developed a new one from scratch (no pun intended) called instadeq[3], which later I found out is part of a family of programming languages known as programming by demonstration (knowing about them before starting would have made it faster to develop it :slightly_smiling_face:).  Last October we migrated our customers from event fabric to instadeq and now we are focusing on launching the SaaS version of it.\n\n[1]  <http://efene.org/>\n[2] <https://www.event-fabric.com/>\n[3] <https://instadeq.com/>",

    "text": "Hi! I'm Spencer. I live in NYC.\n\nI have had crazy ideas about programming languages bouncing around in my head for at least a year now. It seems to me that inadequacies in our programming languages and surrounding tooling are the root cause of most technological troubles.\n\nI've previously worked with computer vision, where I implemented a number of image processing algorithms. The tools we used were grossly insufficient for the task. CUDA was painfully low level, all algorithms became mucked up with performance concerns, code was not portable, build systems were tangled nightmares of dependencies on antiquated software from the 70's... I've been trying to find a better way.\n\nMy ideas are still vague and poorly defined but a month ago I started taking these thoughts seriously. I've been learning type theory in an attempt to gain the necessary background to either implement my ideas or determine if they are even feasible. I have a very long way to go to acquire enough background to even understand what I'm getting into... but you have to start somewhere!",

    "text": "Hello everyone! Many thanks to <@U5STGTB3J> for inviting me to this place. My name is Joel and I live in Cambridge, UK, where I completed my CS undergraduate degree last summer. For the past year I've been a software engineer in a local startup. But it is my working on my blog (<https://programmingmadecomplicated.wordpress.com>) and on the general vision that we share here, that gives me true fulfillment - especially since nobody I've met in real life expresses any sort of interest or enthusiasm about this sort of thing. Fortunately I've found many who do online, and I'll eagerly attend any meetups in the UK.\n\nOrigin story is, in a nutshell: I wanted to make games as a kid so I learned GameMaker. I then traded the ability to make games for learning to Code Properly and now I want my creativity-outlet back :angry:\n\nI would try different programming languages and libraries, different paradigms, design patterns, and all sorts of elaborate schemes to manage the complexity of code in my various barely-started game projects. I enlisted as a main developer for an online fan game project, and couldn't deliver the goods. I eventually developed some sort of philosophical paralysis about programming in general, questioning my life choices and wondering if I could ever tolerate the career path I was headed towards, until I was snapped out of it from finding Alan Kay, Bret Victor and VPRI on the 'net roughly two years ago. Finally I realised that one of my basic foundations, that of \"language being primary / fundamental\", was in reality a limiting box of artificial creation :slightly_smiling_face:\nAnd now I really, really want to explore bootstrapping and try to bootstrap a graphical system somehow using shapes instead of source code.\n\n(meanwhile, at work I just do normal frustrating software-engineer stuff :neutral_face: but I will not stay there forever.)",

    "text": "Hi everyone! Lately I tend to introduce myself as a barbarian programmer. I mean that in a few different ways:\n\n• I tend to be a curmudgeon, happier by myself than \"organizing\" into groups to achieve some shared goal. This doesn't mean I dislike collaboration. I just think we tend to conflate collaboration with _synchronous_ collaboration, and asynchronous collaboration is a better fit for many tasks. Asynchronous collaboration can span great distances in space and time. You reading Aristotle could be asynchronous collaboration -- if you are then able to build on what you read in some way and put out some artifact that someone else can collaborate with. UX people like to say \"don't make me think\". I like to say \"don't make me talk to you\". Show me what you built in a form that I can read, listen to, play interactively with and gradually understand/appreciate. I may still come talk to you if the situation merits it (I actually love talking to people, believe it or not), but give me the choice.\n• I think we've been doing city-living cheek-by-jowl for so long that we've forgotten what benefits it has, and continue cargo-culting it long after it's become superfluous. I don't mean that literally; I love living in cities. But our software stacks have many of the same patterns as cities, and they aren't really necessary: a) promiscuously adding dependencies, b) relying implicitly on some sort of division of labor, so that if we find a problem in a dependency we don't feel empowered to fix it for ourselves, instead turning to ways to try to get others to do it for us like paying, bullying, cajoling, passing laws, etc. It's worth swinging that pendulum back a bit, to imagine we're out on the steppe with just what we have on our backs and nobody else around for miles, and try to achieve our ends with 10x fewer libraries and frameworks. (More details: <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16882140#16882555> .)\n• It emphasizes sustainability. When you live off the land (I gather; I wouldn't actually know) you are more attuned to how you affect your environment. Your _externalities_. We city dwellers just expect someone else to cart our trash out for us.\n\nUnfortunately this is all aspirational, because the way we write software doesn't really work for a barbarian. I've been working very slowly on extricating a kernel of software and way of writing software that can be more self-sufficient and sustainable. I started out building a new programming language based on Lisp (<http://akkartik.name/post/wart>, which itself grew out of a startup; those who can't startup shave yaks), then grew frustrated with the stack below me and simultaneously realized languages don't matter, and build a toy VM and OS (<https://github.com/akkartik/mu#readme> ; <http://akkartik.name/about>), used it to teach programming for a couple of years, then grew frustrated with how slow it was and gradually faced up to the need to understand even more low-level details. Lately I've been building simple tools for programming in machine code (<https://github.com/akkartik/mu/tree/master/subx#readme>), but in the past week I've set this aside to design a type-safe language that I can bootstrap out of machine code (no link yet).",

It's true there aren't many games where creation and editing is a first class feature, but in most video games (even in games were simulation and immersion are important) its not the goal, and encouraging free modification would \"break\" the game.  You can make arguments that for single player games that doesn't matter, but it does end up removing challenge.\n\nThat said a lot of games support modding as an important thing, even if you have to download a mod sdk, and editing isn't completely intuitive, etc.   This includes major, super popular games that begat even more popular games through modification (Warcraft 3 -&gt; Dota, Half-Life -&gt; Counterstrike, ARMA 3 -&gt; PUBG). Media Molecule's games Little Big Planet and the upcoming Dreams make creation first class, so you probably want to check those out if that's your main frustration.  This is a bad example coming from someone that's not really familiar with video game history or design.  It makes sense coming from someone that remembers some random game that they either couldn't edit or didn't know how, and that's a valid complaint, but its not representative of games as a whole.",

    "text": "Halo is a great example of a game series that has supported modification in a first class way, even on console which is rare due to technical and market constraints.  I don't think the original xbox version of Halo had modification, but Halo 3 allowed for custom game modes and had forge (<https://www.halopedia.org/Forge>) which allowed you to customize maps.  With Halo its tricky though because eventually you run into the technical constraints of console games, unless you build your game from the ground up to also be an editor and programming environment (at the sacrifice of quality), console games run into memory, compute and security issues.  Console games are made on PCs that are significantly more powerful than the consoles they run on, and often have build processes that do hours or days of precomputation using distributed build processes (for example ray tracing for lighting).  Once again you can build, but the goal of most console games (and the desire of the market) is not creative expression.",

        "text": "Latent semantic analysis (LSA) is a technique in natural language processing, in particular distributional semantics, of analyzing relationships between a set of documents and the terms they contain by producing a set of concepts related to the documents and terms.  LSA assumes that words that are close in meaning will occur in similar pieces of text (the distributional hypothesis).  A matrix containing word counts per paragraph (rows represent unique words and columns represent each paragraph) is constructed from a large piece of text and a mathematical technique called singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to reduce the number of rows while preserving the similarity structure among columns.  Words are then compared by taking the cosine of the angle between the two vectors (or the dot product between the normalizations of the two vectors) formed by any two rows.  Values close to 1 represent very similar words while values close to 0 represent very dissimilar words.An information retrieval technique using latent semantic structure was patented in 1988 (US Patent 4,839,853, now expired) by Scott Deerwester, Susan Dumais, George Furnas, Richard Harshman, Thomas Landauer, Karen Lochbaum and Lynn Streeter. In the context of its application to information retrieval, it is sometimes called latent semantic indexing (LSI).",

    "text": "Hiya, I live in London and currently work on a consumer app that's unrelated to all this.\n\nHowever, lately I've been gripped by the idea that the way we build our computing systems today can't possibly be sustainable. Assuming we're still computing in 1000 years, I'm convinced it won't look like this—so how do we start moving in that direction?\n\nAt the beginning of my career almost 20 years ago I worked on a system at MAYA Design (Civium/Visage/VIA Repository) that used unconventional approaches like storing data in key-value dictionaries with UUIDs that could be easily distributed/synced across the network, as well as a message-based/boxes-and-wires programming model where the code modules were also stored in these dictionaries, so that computing could happen wherever was convenient. (It mostly worked, but was a bit slow.)\n\nI'm interested in seeing what systems have been built since then that explore similar ideas, since I feel that data storage &amp; management is a useful lens to help us see the future of computing. I've already spent a few days following links from this Slack, and the closest things I found so far were the Houyhnhnm Computing essays, <http://Sandstorm.io|Sandstorm.io>, IPFS, Urbit, and Camlistore. (I'd appreciate pointers to other things in that vein.)\n\nI'm also very interested in the meta-problem of how to architect new technologies in a way that aligns people's and companies' incentives to increase their chances of getting developed and adopted.\n\nThanks to <@U5TCAFTD3> for building this beacon to help us find each other, and to <@U5STGTB3J> for getting me on board. Looking forward to meeting some of you at a future London meetup!",

I discovered the podcast while researching folks who were teaching Elm as a first programming language. The first episode to which I listened was Professor Anand’s interview, and it remains one of my favorites. In the last couple years, I’ve become very involved in the Elm community, and I’m excited about its potential as a tool to teach programming.\n\nI’m a based in Chicago. Currently, I’m not working on anything worth promoting. I just wrapped up some experiments with a BEAM backend for the Elm compiler, which may be interesting to some folks here: <https://kofi.sexy/blog/elm-beam>. At this point, I’m primarily here to learn more about the work happening in this area. I’m also open to opportunities to transition my own career in that direction. Looking forward to great conversations!",

    "text": "Hi everybody! I’m a programmer based in Dubai/Kashmir. I’m a Mechanical engineer by training, but have been programming since a very young age. I tried to build multiple edtech products before this, and all of them failed and taught me important lessons and I’m happy to be a better developer and even better person because of those experiences. I love reading the works of Vannevar Bush, Alan Kay and Bret Victor. I also like hiking and camping, and also Urdu/Persian/Kashmiri poetry.\n\nI’m currently working on a project which doesn’t have a name yet. But I’m basically trying to build a new type of digital document which is intended to be non-linear, dynamic, and action-oriented.\n\nThe document can be made using an editor that I’m currently building which will resemble Google Docs in terms of UI, but the document itself will allow writers to write in a format that allows you to “dive deeper” into particular sections of text allowing readers to go down a “rabbit hole” or skim a document.\n\nThe document will also be connected to various webservices and will allow users to construct pipelines of actions/triggers which can modify it, for example — “When somebody mentions me on Twitter, add a row to this table on this document, send an SMS to my friend, and then set the value of the “mentions” column on this other table to +1 from what it is already” .\n\nI don’t have a name for the project right now, but I’m close to launching a public version of it. I wish to speak with people who can critique the idea, offer some feedback, or even if it sounds useful/useless I am happy to hear more about why/why not.\n\nI am also applying to business school these days and sorting out my GMAT, although if I could afford it, I would just focus on building this full time.",

    "text": "Hello everyone. :wave:\n\nI want to reinvent programming, or help anyone else who is, because I fear that we are squandering human achievement otherwise. Computers are the pinnacle of human invention, a universal machine, and we have locked their use behind a techno priesthood who speak arcane runes. Instead of computers becoming the bicycle of the mind we have created TV 2.0. It seems ridiculous and hugely inefficient to me that the people with domain specific knowledge need to hire others to encode that knowledge into a computer program. We should create tools to enable the domain expert.\n\nI’m currently working on a bimodal visualization of React Components. Bimodal because both the visual and the textual views are first class meaning changes are propagated to the other. I’m very interested in bimodal types of programming as I feel that while text is great at expressing detail, it isn’t as effective as visuals in communicating structure and relationships. I’m limiting this tool to React Components because I’m unsure if this tool will actually be very effective and I want a well defined and small space to play in.\n\nIf anyone wants to grab a beer/coffee/tea in Pittsburgh, PA and talk programming just DM me.",

    "text": "Aloha, everyone! A few years ago, I co-founded a company with the specific mission of reinventing the development experience. On the practical side, this means that we build a new kind of an IDE called the Glamorous Toolkit. However, our main focus is on the human behavior, and as we build our environment, we create several new techniques. We call the overall approach moldable development based on the idea that the environment must adapt to the context of our system. I can say that I now program fundamentally different than I did 5 years ago.\n\nGlamorous Toolkit is implemented in Pharo and it comes with a complete graphical stack that has some interesting properties. For example, it includes a live documentation and notebook technology right in the IDE. We reached a first alpha version a couple of months ago. I'd love to talk about it and other people's experience. Some details can be found here: <https://feenk.com/gt>",

I'm a Twitter fan of <@U5TCAFTD3> and the work of lots of people here.\n\nI've dabbled with programming environment projects like <http://dalsegno.ballingt.com/> mostly because I was trying to copy some work <https://maryrosecook.com> was doing, finally signed up for this Slack while watching Chris Granger's LIVE talk. I'm excited about programming education (I volunteer with Software Carpentry and worked at the Recurse Center for 4 years) and have reached the point where I've been excited about possible programming futures for long enough to start being a little questioning, but I'm not cynical yet :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nOh I'm interesting and occasionally involved in the IPython/Jupyter world, and I still like REPLs and wrote a new terminal frontend for bpython - I liked the rewind feature and made some changes to it that makes it more exciting for live-coding.",

Recently I am self educating myself on programming and facing the problem that I feel a lot of people will be facing since getting into “knowing” what to do with a computer and in the computer is unavoidable. There is a need of thinking in more abstract terms that would allow learning through common logic of human mind rather than education done in unfamiliar to non-computer oriented mind language that describes another unknown language that talks to unknown and sometime “scary” beast - computer. Languages I have learn so far are Javascript, Elixir, Python, (html,css ), some Golang. While I am introducing myself to languages I am growing in understanding on difficulties and trying to bring into my mind solutions how things could be explained in more “human terms” and logic. I hope participating in this group will introduce new paths for people to cross the gap from not knowing into knowing what to do and how to approach computer programming.  ",

We also have a curl importer that tries to translate the command into a Postman request. Could you ask her to try that? Over the past 5 years of building Postman, I have realized that debugging an API call is actually a pretty hard problem with so many layers of technology involved. I read Mindstorms a while back and been trying to use that to guide users on how they can better understand what’s going on and peel these layers back.",

I work at a data pipeline startup, and help run both Boston's Elm Meetup and a weekly functional programming meetup with a few friends.\n\nI also have a future-of-coding-esqe personal project that I've been mapping out for a while, and want to get more serious about implementing. The use case is rapidly developing and combining little personal systems for note-taking, note-organizing, goal tracking, task prioritization, etc. The system itself will be a combination visual + textual editor for a big strongly typed frp-ish program, plus a live-updating view that's a user-defined pure function of the state of the frp network. I'm trying to make it so that \"if it compiles, it's deployed\". I am in way over my head with this and will need all the help I can get!",

    "text": "Hi! I'm Michael Arntzenius, I go by \"rntz\" online. I used to think I would reinvent programming all by my lonesome. Then I realized it might be a tad more difficult than I thought, so I scaled back. Nowadays I'm mostly chugging away in academia at little problems that I can make headway on, like: how do we combine functional and relational/set-oriented programming nicely? (For that, see <http://www.rntz.net/datafun/>) But I'm still interested in the bigger picture. Themes I keep coming back to are:\n\n1. Small programs. Ideas last longer than code. So make your code small enough it becomes an idea.\n\n2. Monotonicity: systems that always go in \"one direction\", eg. append-only databases, CRDTs, LVars, propagators, recursion in Datalog...\n\n3. Incrementality. I think a lot of code is incidentally complex because it's trying to handle _change_ efficiently. How can we make this easy?\n\n4. Unexpected uses of simple type systems. Eg. To enforce monotonicity; or, as dynamic contracts rather than static guarantees; or, as data for metaprogramming with.\n\n5. Communication. Maybe the future is in lots of special-purpose tools/langs, not one tool to rule them all. But for that to work, we need tools that work together well. Unix byte-streams were a useful first step in this direction, but are too limiting.\n\nI joined this Slack after seeing on Twitter that there had been a meetup in London. I live in Oxford, so maybe I can come down the next time a meetup happens.\n\nAlso, hello <@UE3KC0VK6>!",

    "text": "Hi - I am Antranig Basman. I'm part of an overlapping group of publicly funded projects to improve people's access to technology. These are funded under the general headline of \"accessibility\" and improving the lives of people with disabilities, but we quickly realised that this mission will be uneconomic and unpractical unless we reform the way technology is built, and most importantly eliminate the use of all currently popular programming languages.\n\nWhat we seek is to \"democratise the affordances of computation\" so that they can be accessed with as few barriers as possible imposed by interaction modality, style of cognition, representation, etc. We say \"the affordances of computation\" rather than \"computation\" since we believe what the public needs is not well described by computation as classically conceived.\n\nIf you're interested in a semi-technical exposition of what this means in terms of a conception of \"Open Authorship\", you can read my Onward 2018 preprint at <https://github.com/amb26/papers/blob/master/onward-2016/onward-2016.pdf> - I live in London, looking forward to chatting with you all about many topics of interest! I'm particularly interested these days in reading about the philosophy and history of the numerous scientific and mathematical concepts that we tend to take for granted, and am a great fan of Lakatos, Lakoff, and Lakos.",

    "text": "Hi, I'm Jack Armitage. I am a PhD student in Media &amp; Arts Technologies in the Augmented Instruments Lab, Centre for Digital Music, Queen Mary University of London.\n\nI have been studying music technology and musical instrument design for around 10 years. My undergrad was BSc Music, Multimedia &amp; Electronics at the University of Leeds, and after that I was a research engineer at <http://www.roli.com|www.roli.com> and later <http://www.fxpansion.com|www.fxpansion.com> working on instrument quality and developing visuo-tactile materials and interfaces. My PhD focuses on craft in digital musical instrument design, and how one's \"ability to craft\" is impacted by the tools, methods and technologies used (<https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=APvoBhUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en>).\n\nI was somehow exposed to Bret Victor's Inventing on Principle around 2012 at the end of my undergrad, and from there I became quite obsessed with the history of 'The New Medium'. While working in the music technology industry I was seeing everything through Bret Victor and Alan Kay's eyes; 10's of expert designers and engineers spending 10's of thousands of pounds and 6 months to explore singular, basic ideas, and as a result not having any time or money - or even awareness - of possible 'bigger ideas' that could be explored.\n\nI started my PhD wanting to solve these problems by creating new tools and programming languages that treat instrument designers as artists (see 'Artists and the Art of the Luthier' by Bill Buxton). However I made the mistake of interviewing violin makers in my first study, which has taken me down the rabbit hole of embodied craft practice, which I am now trying to reconcile with digital technology :slightly_smiling_face:. In my spare time I compose and produce music, and 'live code' music onstage using Haskell (<http://tidalcycles.org>). My latest music project just launched on Tuesday: <http://offer.band>\n\nBased in London, always happy to talk over email or meet up for a coffee, and host visits to the Instruments Lab (<http://instrumentslab.org>). Thank you <@U5TCAFTD3> for inviting me to the recent London meetup and subsequently to this group. I am very intrigued to learn more about the people in this group!",

I generally like the stuff that I'm sure most people like : Lisps, Smalltalk, Parc, HARC.\n\nMy current thinking on new languages / areas of investigation / demands in my manifesto are these :\n\n1) expressing computation is a solved problem. We have Lambda calculus, Lisp-like functions, Smalltalk-like messages. These are fine. We don't need to worry about these.\n\nThe areas we need to explore further are in expressing complex data-structures, \"architecture\" and constraints. My recent thinking on OO is that what makes OO \"hard\" is that we don't have good ways of expressing larger scale assemblages of objects. And there's too much focus on the individual class, rather than the collective of how classes or objects act together.\n\n2) A second problem is that programming languages make us do the work in an order that suits them. Our job as programmers is to give a number of constraints to the computer that define a program. The problem is that the computer makes us give the constraints in the order and format that is convenient for it. Often requiring us to fit into architectural restrictions that we don't, in fact, care about but which are part of the fussy housekeeping of the system ... eg. why am I jumping between different files to fill in information about model, about view, about database, about client UI? Etc? Why can't I express what's important to me, in one place, in the order that suits me, and have the computer go back and wire these together?\n\nThe first of these thoughts is making me interested in grammars. And the way that ML or Haskell define complex data-schema with algebraic data-types in an almost Backus-Naur style. Can we use something like this to declare assemblages of objects? (See a discussion here : <https://www.quora.com/q/qqylyzqgpwisoecc/Whats-wrong-with-OO> )\n\nThe second of these thoughts has me looking into logic programming in Prolog and Minikanren where we \"flatten\" our program into a sequence of facts and rules which can be added in more or less any order, leaving the inference engine running around drawing out the implications. (See my discussion with Alexander Tchitchigin in the comments of this : <https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-programming-language-you-are-looking-for-and-why/answer/Phil-Jones> )",

    "text": "Hi all! I’m a Computational Media PhD student at the Expressive Intelligence Studio at UC Santa Cruz, working on approachable and playful mixed-initiative (AI+human creative collaboration) tools to augment human creativity. Like a lot of you, Bret Victor’s work was probably the main thing that got me into future-of-programming stuff, but I’m also inspired by games like Spore that place the process of creating stuff at the center of the play experience. More recently I’ve been thinking a lot about the problem of how to empower people to shape their digital social environments to suit their personal and community-specific needs.\n\nI’m nominally an “AI researcher”, but I think the approaches to AI that are currently in vogue make a critical mistake: they focus way too much on _guessing_ what people want rather than _asking_ them what they want (and giving them the languages they need to answer properly). As a result, all of the AI problems I’m interested in end up also being HCI and/or PL problems to some extent, and my work keeps overlapping with future-of-programming stuff in interesting ways.\n\nSome of you probably recognize me from Twitter; I’m <https://twitter.com/maxkreminski>. My personal website and blog is at <https://mkremins.github.io>.",

    "text": "Hi all,\n- I came across the future of coding podcast a few weeks ago, and got through just about all of the back catalogue by listening whenever I was driving\n\n- I'm from the UK, currently near Bristol.\n\n- My undergrad was in Ergonomics/Human Factors Design\n\t- My dissertation was on improving the graphical communication of a commonly used (in the field) cognitive tool/methodology (hierarchical task analysis)\n\n- I've done a lot more programming in C than Javascript/functional languages, so I may be coming from a slightly different place than many here, but hey, it takes all sorts right?! :wink:\n\t- I'm also a 'fan' of the Handmade Hero/Handmade Network approach to programming. I'm hoping that these aren't incompatible!\n\t- I do want the programmer/software design experience to be better, but I want to make sure this is not at the expense of the end user of the software.\n\t\t- The key components of the argument are roughly\n\t\t\t- We can't expect improved hardware to account for reduced software performance:\n\t\t\t\t1) Individual processors seem to have reached a heat barrier in terms of clock speed\n\t\t\t\t2) Most problems are not trivially parallelizable across multiple processors.\n\t\t\t- Generalized abstractions tend to have a significant performance cost attached\n\t\t- As such, there is (at least for the moment) a class of problems where the cost of writing in beautiful abstractions is too high in terms of end program performance.\n\t\t- For this area, I think that the biggest wins are likely to be in improving the UI/UX/representation and reducing the feedback loop\n\t- I've previously made rudimentary C tools aimed at reducing the feedback loop - live recompiling, live variable editing.\n\n- I'm currently working on something similar to Glen Chiacchieri's REPLugger using LLVM/Clang. This is starting with C(++), but should hopefully not be too difficult to add frontends for other compiled languages due to the way LLVM works.",

I'm an untrained, uneducated freelance web dev in Tennessee who, about 3 years ago, thought: \"wouldn't be cool if you could actually see programs?\"  Since then I've discovered Fred Brooks, Bret Victor, VISSOFT, and, well, Computer Science in general.

My initial goal has refined, but is largely unchanged: create massive visualizations of software behaviour for experienced workaday programmers.  My current stab looks like this:\n\nTarget language: JavaScript (preferable ES6)\nAnalysis method: instrumentation and dynamic analysis\nDrawing: WebGL\nTarget elements of software behaviour: data flow within control flow",

    "text": "Hey folks, I'm Jasim and for a long time I thought that programming was just expressions, mutation, loops, and i/o - and you had it all. \"Give me a Turing machine and I shall move mountains\" or something like that.\n\nBut one day I had enough - a Javascript framework I used at work was not performant, yet I couldn't dig down because its abstractions were opaque and non-programmable. And it was making it difficult to do my job, causing real stress. But I couldn't put my hands on what was actually wrong. Was it my lack of understanding, or had it to do with the tool itself? To get to its root I had to understand programming at a meta-level and that rabbit hole took me into CTM by Peter Van Roy, who describes it thus:\n\n&gt; We define programming, as a general human activity, to mean the act of extending or changing a system's functionality. Programming is a widespread activity that is done both by nonspecialists (eg: consumers who change the settings of their alarm clock or cellular phone) and specialists (computer programmers, the audience for this book).\n\nI see the _future of programming_ as this infinite game were things that previously needed specialists keep moving into non-specialist territory, yet the field keeps growing and constantly keeps giving birth to new specialisations.\n\nAnd I'm working on a product at a distant proximity to this: a tool for UI designers that makes their designs live by providing clean &amp; precise HTML and CSS as they design. It is called Protoship Codegen and is at <https://protoship.io>.\n\nI tweet at <http://twitter.com/jasim_ab|twitter.com/jasim_ab>, where I mostly advocate for the mainstreaming of Typed Functional Programming, am a regular listener of the podcast, and am excited to meet you all!",

Thanks!\n\nWe do ML (ReasonML), but not Machine Learning :slightly_smiling_face: Two reasons:\n1) we learned the hard way that heuristics makes the product unusable. If the results are not predictable, users have a hard time building habits around it. We want a 1:1 cause/effect relationship between the design and the output.\n\n2) many attempts in this space treat ML as a blackbox - take an entire design and feed it into an algorithm and hope for good results. We're generating code that can be put in use for building complex web applications, not just websites. This means the generated code should aspire to be as perfect as possible, and programmers should be able to grok it immediately. There are areas were ML will be useful in a fine-grained manner; a scalpel than a hammer, but at the moment we're able to produce great results with a good old fashioned expert system.",

    "text": "Hello! I am a frontend developer from Kharkiv (Ukraine). I contribute to open source projects and work on my own framework called Rete.js. <http://rete.js.org>\n\nI started learning programming more than 5 years ago, studied languages ​​ PHP -&gt; JS -&gt; C++ -&gt; C# -&gt; Java -&gt; ES6/TS. Now basically I programming on JavaScript.\n\nAt the moment I see the benefit for myself in languages ​​such as JS/TS and C++, but one of the problems still remains - writing the code. Perhaps someone will argue that you need to have a good knowledge  of programming language. I agree, good knowledge will allow you to write quality code, but there are problems with reading someone else's code that is written in a different style (or has poor quality).\n\nBeing inspired by UE4, Substance Designer and Plant factory I decided to write my own library for creating such editors in the browser (dataflow programming). At that time (as now) I didn’t find a universal and customizable framework/library. I have started writing a library called D3-Node-Editor (March, 2017) and after a year of development I revised many approaches and rewrote it to the new architecture and called Rete.js. <https://github.com/retejs/rete>\n\nAre there somebody who have experience in Dataflow programming and know the current unsolved problems? I'm going to postgraduate studies to working with dataflow and my framework, but my scientific director (I hope I correctly translated to english phrase \"научный руководитель\") says that a dissertation must contains scientific novelty, and framework is only a tool. So I am not sure whether to continue studying at the university in order to do this, since among professors no one has much experience with visual programming.",

This is a collection of introductory, expository notes on applied category theory, inspired by the 2018 Applied Category Theory Workshop, and in these notes we take a leisurely stroll through two themes (functorial semantics and compositionality), two constructions (monoidal categories and decorated cospans) and two examples (chemical reaction networks and natural language processing) within the field.\n\nCheck it out!",

I'm a member of the Scala SIP (ie. language design) committee and a contributor to both Scala 2 and the upcoming Scala 3 (aka Dotty) compiler ... currently my day job is 50% work on the latter. I'm also the author of shapeless, Scala's main generic programming library, and a cofounder of Typelevel, an umbrella group for Scala projects which focuses on the typed functional end of the Scala spectrum combined with a desire to create a welcoming environment for people coming from outside that tradition.\nTypes are very much my thing, and I take the view that dependent types in particular are the future. I think of Scala and Haskell as being the partially dependent status quo, and languages like Agda and Idris showing the way ahead.",

Also the guarantees they provide can be useful for things like bi-directional programming (<http://ravichugh.github.io/sketch-n-sketch/>).\n\nI'm curious about Dotty - I've wanted to learn how it does incremental compilation and have watched an Odersky talk about it. My main question was how it caches compilation results, and how to compute cache keys for AST nodes efficiently (if that is how it is done).",

    "text": "It isn't hard to prove that JavaScript is about 99% a perfect copy of AS2, because you can write a program in AS3, run it through a type-stripper find'replace script and voila you have a JavaScript program. Nowadays with the ES2015 and later additions to JS they have crept towards AS3 which although it has types so it is more like JS of the future does show the shameless copying that the JS team has done of the AS language. I just converted 25,000 lines of code the other day from AS3 to JS. You can tell it is a copy because of the strange quirks in AS which were copied verbatim. For example, when you ask the date functions for the month of their in AS2/3 it returns the month based on 0, but the day based on 1. The JS date functions do this identically. And the Math... library is almost identical. When you have worked with converting AS3 code (originating from Adobe's Flash Builder, you can see how close they really are. They can't admit they copied it for legal reasons, so the myth that magically a fully formed syntax emerged in a mere 2 weeks persists. Larry Ellison once he bought Sun spent serious money suing Google over how Java was used, and to avoid another incident like that nobody wants to bring up the subject. Frankly Adobe is a much nicer company than Sun, and  I doubt they would ever be so litigious as Oracle is. What annoys me is how poorly they have copied the AS3 features like Modules; the ES Module system is deeply flawed because the implementors have misread the specification on modules, and if you have a module like Math, and import all the symbols, using import * from Math, and refer to a function in Math that doesn't exist, the compiler doesn't catch it. Oops! that is pretty dumb. The current JS compilers think of a module name as an object with an undefined property.  Once again people have neglected to study Prof. Wirth's brilliant work with Modula-2.",

But since I just keep pushing the date, I'll cut the crap and say hi: Hi :wave: Also I just started listening to <@U5TCAFTD3>'s podcast and it's been eerie (and fulfilling) to hear so similar thoughts.\nMy thinking for the last few years has been around more incremental improvements to the programming status quo. ~2 years ago I built a JSON editor that doesn't let you syntax error (<https://gregoor.github.io/syntactor>). It was supposed to be a full JS editor, but I drowned in TODOS. I talked about the project at the Salon des Refuses of that year (and met <@UEJDZRQB1>, nice to see you here :slightly_smiling_face: ).\nI've restarted the project a couple of months ago and I'm close to having it in a state worth showing. It's not super out there (you're still \"just writing\" JavaScript) but I think it's a step out of the text-manipulation stone age we currently live in.\nIn my day job I work as the lead developer on Mozilla's Common Voice (<https://voice.mozilla.org/en>). Leave your voice if you want to contribute to an open data set :upside_down_face: I live in Berlin, so if you're around ping me, and I'll show you some great vietnamese restaurant. :ramen:",

    "text": "hi team!\nI've been following <@U5TCAFTD3> for a while.. and now is the time to join.\n\nMy thesis and my team's is that everyone should have access to general purpose computation, so that they can unlock data and processes that only they can customize. Our approach is to package the basic ingredients (logic, I/O, clocks, persistence and \"databases\") into the functions of the cells of a spreadsheet. Like lego.\n\nMy initial thinking on the matter started a few years back (<https://www.patife.com/entries/9/>).\nWe're launching in a couple of weeks at <http://dashdash.com|dashdash.com>. we're a 2-year old startup where i'm a product owner and CEO in a great team of 24.\n\nso far we have built\n- the regular excel functions like vlookup(), min(), max(), etc (same names, syntax, types and coercion)\n- new: web functions like get(), post(), and integrations that give you send_sms() and more\n- new: automation with repeat(  , period)\n- new: side effects with insert() and update() for table-to-table operations.\nYou can find a video of an example of what we do here <https://twitter.com/patife/status/1086345026643394560>\n\nI hope to get feedback on our product and explore how to _translate_ programming for non-techies, which functions to build, and how to avoid people taping into dangerous resources. you can follow me at <https://twitter.com/patife/>",

    "text": "Hi, I'm Duncan,\n\nI'm building <https://thorny.io>, an interactive notebook for decision making.\nI want to help engineers tackle overwhelming design, planning and strategy problems where multiple decisions are tangled together.\n\nThe end goal is not a programming tool but it is still an end-user computation problem because at their most general level, decisions, plans and reasoning, are actually types of computation.\n\nThe underlying structure is a knowledge graph which includes possibilities and reasoning (similar to syntax tree).\nLike a spreadsheet, if you change the reasoning, decisions or beliefs, then the consequences ripple through the graph.\nThe UI I have been exploring is\n- an outliner (effectively a structure editor for a reasoning notation)\n- with spreadsheet power (it supports formulas that reference other parts of the knowledge graph)\nThe demos on the site are out of date and baffling, I will update them with the current version shortly!\n\nI am based in Bristol UK. I studied CompSci at Cambridge and was previously head of software at an engineering firm building various design and optimization tools for engineers. I am interested in the typical Brett Victor topics plus:\n- non-monotonic reasoning\n- belief networks\n- logic programming\n- argument mapping\n- optimization and solvers\n\nI have also built various compilers, code generation and visualization tools.\nI want to work more in the open and share more but I find it tough.\nI am so impressed with <@U5TCAFTD3> and this community, I have so much to learn here!",

    "text": "Hello all! I’ve been hanging around this community since I attended the first London meetup, so it’s probably about time I introduced myself. :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nI’m an Australian software developer currently working as a contractor in London and looking forward to working in other global cities in the future. Was fortunate enough to discover computers around age 12, got my first paid development job at 15 (couldn’t believe that I could get paid to do something I already enjoy!) and never looked back. Worked with various languages, projects and stacks. These days it’s Typescript, Javascript, Rx and C#. Maybe (hopefully!) Scala in the near future.\n\nMy formal education is a bit scant, but I’ve reading up and doing courses here and there. Some books I really enjoyed were ‘A Philosophy of Software Design’ (Outsterhout), ‘Code Complete’ (McConnel) and ‘Design Patterns’ (GOF). And this community has also been a fount of resources.\n\nI constantly feel like a beginner with software, and maybe it’ll be that way for life, but I still want to advance my knowledge.\n\nI’m especially interested in the craft of coding, the construction of software and systems and the intersection of design and programming. My biggest weakness is fear &amp; ignorance of math, but I’m slowly chipping away at that.\n\nI’m very fond of certain kinds of music that have a systematic and/or cyclic element to them. I especially love the symphonies of Anton Bruckner, which seem to have an organic complexity and depth that I get totally lost in.\n\nThanks <@U5TCAFTD3> &amp; <@U5STGTB3J> and all of you. Let’s get it started in here! B-)",

    "text": "There aren't a lot of great books on programming, but i can recommend Programs = Algorithms + Data Structures by Prof. Wirth of ETH. He invented Pascal, Modula-2, Oberon, the Lilith computer. His Modula-2 language was the high-water mark in the 70's for languages, and aspects of it have not been matched yet in any other language i am aware of. I would burn \"Code Complete\". Any company that has over a million outstanding unresolved bugs in their OS has no business writing a book on how to program properly. By any objective measurement, MS is one of the most inefficient companies in the history of computers. The previous most inefficient company was IBM, and indeed MS is better than they were, but seriously their systems are like swiss cheese.  Wirth's books are short, economical, beautiful work.",

    "text": "The Requiem by Maurice Durflé is a killer work. He takes you straight to heaven. If you are interested in mystic music, you might look at Scriabin's piano works. He was working on a super-work called the Mysterium that would cause spontaneous enlightenment. He was a very interesting fellow. Also post-awakening John Coltrane is wonderful stuff. Myself for programming i used Anoushka Shankar to power the first year of my project. She's better than her father was, and he was great. Rhythmic music helps with typing.",

    "text": "Hi all :wave:\nI'm a developer based in Cambridge, UK. I discovered Future of Coding thanks to <@UFD2JRE58> and especially liked the episode about React history with Pete Hunt. I currently code in TypeScript and Swift, but I've done my first more or less serious coding in my life in Scheme and Tcl. Also had a bit of production experience with Haskell as well. I see there are mentions of music interests and visual programming here, and both topics are quite interesting to me. In my spare time I like poking modular synthesisers in something like Audulus (<http://audulus.com>)\n\nI'm currently building a framework inspired by React in pure Swift. I was very excited when React Hooks were announced, so I decided to drop the class-based API altogether and only implement a Hooks API. I still need to implement a few more hooks and host components, but I hope I'm much closer to a point where it can be used for real iOS apps and some other platforms in the future, when more renders are added. You can check out my current progress here if you're interested: <https://github.com/MaxDesiatov/Gluon>\nIf this thing gets any traction, I'd like to build visual developer tools for it in the future.\n\nThanks for the podcast and the community, super excited to learn more from you all!",

    "text": "Dear Ms. Solstad,  if your abstract algebra is good, programming will be easy. Frankly programming uses very little math; the necessary pre-requisites are not taught well in school however; you can go through calculus and not be exposed to what they call \"discrete math\", which includes set theory, boolean algebra, combinatorics, etc.  You are entering the field at an odd time in history, because programming was once easier, but more limited. Now, with billions of computers around in all sizes, programming has become very challenging, and the haphazard way the dominant programming stacks were created has resulted in a huge mess. Javascript, which by many measures is the #1 language is a \"hot mess\" as they call it. We are at what i perceive was the tail end of OOP era, and are at the boundary of a whole new, much easier era, So it is a great time to jump in if you look forward a bit. One of the best ways to learn is to build something very simple. Find the absolutely simplest thing you can imagine, and do that. My first program was finding the area of a triangle. Motivation precedes achievement, and since you want to make more human things, perhaps you can apply your knowledge of stage directing and acting to think of some tool that would benefit actors to memorize lines, or tools synchronize lighting cues, or something that combines your real world knowledge, and programming. It has been somewhat tragic that computer programmers are often in charge of figuring out what to build, when they don't have knowledge of the outside world. You can be a very successful programmer, and never leave your bathrobe and slippers.",

    "text": "\"1) expressing computation is a solved problem. We have Lambda calculus, Lisp-like functions, Smalltalk-like messages. These are fine. We don't need to worry about these.\"\n\nI'm not sure.... if it were a solved problem, couldn't we all agree about how to do it?\n\nEvery language seems to express even basic computation a little differently. What is 0x4000'0000 + 0x9000'0000? In some languages it's a syntax error, in some it's +0xD000'0000, in some -805'306'368, and in some you get a runtime exception. There are seemingly legitimate reasons why each language made the choice it did, and I don't think we've done a good job at standardizing any of the basic decisions that go into our languages. We certainly haven't specified things in a way that would make it practical to convert code between programming languages, and so everybody picks one language in which to write a library and if the language from which you'd like to use the library isn't the same language, you're sh*t out of luck.\n\nThat's why one of my big interests is on standardizing this stuff without belittling any of the popular semantic choices - I mean, it's easy for comp-sci types, for example, to say \"+0xD000'0000 is obviously the right answer, we just need our systems to use that as the answer\", but no, in reality -805'306'368 or an OverflowException might be a better answer in a particular situation.\n\n\"The second of these thoughts has me looking into logic programming in Prolog and Minikanren where we \"flatten\" our program into a sequence of facts and rules which can be added in more or less any order, leaving the inference engine running around drawing out the implications.\"\n\nMy thinking on this is that this is something I definitely want my programming environment to be *able* to do, but I think the Prolog lovers were mistaken in thinking that in the future all programming would basically be like Prolog programming. I believe there should be a programming language/environment that lets you do *everything* fairly seamlessly - everything from low-level-but-very-fast hand-written vectorized code with mod-2^32 arithmetic, up to theorem proving and prolog-style stuff where the computer magically finds the solution for you (this code may also be fast, eventually, when the underlying algorithms are both optimized and use dynamic codegen). As a consequence I think that the foundation for such an environment must be somehow imperative in its nature, even though functional / declarative / constraint-based / domain-specific ways of programming would be preferred most of the time.",

    "text": "I’ve been dreaming of making some sort of “ultimate programming language” for over 15 years—but to my surprise, never found any like-minded folks until recently. I registered <http://loyc.net/> in 2007 with the idea of making a democratically-extensible compiler with multiple input syntaxes; as time passed it morphed into a set of general ideas for language building. More concretely I wrote the C# parser generator LLLPG and the Lisp-inspired macro system it runs within (it's designed so that the same macro system could support any programming language, I just haven't had time to go beyond C#). But for this group the most relevant thing I've made is LESv2 and LESv3, two simple languages to represent universal syntax trees. I've worked a bit with Jonathan Van der Cruise who made Flame, a compiler-building framework for C#. I learned about Haxe just this year, but I've wanted to build something for several years that would let you write libraries targeting several languages at once. I think I could build something better than Haxe and Cito (Ć) - if only I had some funding and manpower. I’d also be interested in a system for bridging programming languages at run-time so they could communicate seamlessly. For now, I’m too busy at my new job to do anything, including hang out here! (truth be told it's a horrible job and I desperately wish to find something better.) I’ve been bursting with ideas for years and hate being unable to execute on them.\n\nLinks:\n• Loyc trees <http://loyc.net/loyc-trees>\n• LES <http://loyc.net/les> &lt;= Use this to prototype new programming languages\n• LLLPG <http://ecsharp.net/lllpg>\n• LeMP <http://ecsharp.net/lemp>\n• Flame <https://github.com/jonathanvdc/Flame>\n• Haxe <https://haxe.org>",

Many researchers, for instance, have made experimental programming languages and environments - but they can't interoperate with each other! Many languages can only interoperate with C, one of the most archaic languages in existence!\n\nWe must break down these silo walls, so I want to work on those common foundations: to figure out a way to let you write a library in a language that will convert itself to several different languages and run easily on many platforms. To figure out how to standardize everything from point data types (X,Y coordinates), to D-style ranges (an abstraction for subsequences), to whatever data types neural networks are made of, to the way debuggers work. (current thinking: a StackOverflow-like site where people vote on interface designs?). In short, I want to solve the technical problems that create friction in both the niche of programming language design and in the broader world of software engineering. (But, as I say, no time, can't do it. It's funny to have enough urgent work to fill a lifetime, but treat it like a minor hobby to do on weekends sometimes.)\n\nOh and Bret Victor inspired me yada yada I invent on principle blah blah.

    "text": "Welcome! Your introduction resonates more with me than most. I’ve been thinking similarly for a while, and currently (weakly) conclude that our notion of “programming language” is ill-posed.\n\n90% of the complexity of a language is in the implementation and runtime (the “engine”). This complexity is hidden behind a superficially simple skin (the “bumper”). That’s great, but it’s caused programmers to spend all their time arguing about the shape and color of the bumper, with far less attention devoted to the engine itself. We require new models of a car brand to conform to the same exact bumper shapes as before. Everytime somebody gets frustrated with the existing variety of cars, they immediately start thinking about what new shape of bumper to build that will solve all their problems.\n\nI don’t expect you to agree with me, but hopefully you find it thought-provoking. Might the troubles languages have interoperating be a symptom of a deeper malaise? I totally buy the value of interop between languages: it allows one to mix and match multiple runtimes to their diverse strengths. For example, Python with Erlang’s scheduler would be _awesome_. But existing languages are highly constrained in their degrees of freedom, and creating interop in a way that survives version upgrades seems to create even more constraints. What constraints should we trade off in exchange for better interop?",

    "text": "unfortunately it is completely infeasible to bring the languages together. If you stick to rudimentary arithmetical data types like JS' Float64 implied type which holds all numeric values you can map that to C's equivalent, but you can't go the other way, because JS doesn't have int or unsigned int, or single characters, or single precision floating point, nor does it have 64 bit integers and unsigned integers. So right there, between those 2 languages you can't swallow anything general from C unless the C code restricts itself to a small subset emulating JS. One can in general model a more restrictive language in a more expansive one that is closer to the full intel instruction sets. But the goal of sharing libraries between languages is fairly hopeless. Web assembly down the road may become a somewhat standard virtual instruction set, but in Web Assembly you also have the problem that simple atomic things in many languages are very complex internal structures, like the very general array type in JS, and concepts in Python simply don't exist in JS. If the two languages are similar enough, like ActionScript 3 and JS, i have found that simple text editing scripts will convert 99% of AS3 code into JS. So there are some easy mappings out there. Since there are Python to C compilers out there, that mapping has been achieved. But I doubt very much you can go C to Python. So we are fairly doomed to eternity to keep rewriting similar libraries over and over, unless we picked a very stripped down language that could be exported to most others by some straightforward conversion process. Something like Modula-2 which is among the simplest languages ever devised, however, it presumes record structures which don't exist in many languages today, and one would have to restrict oneself to not using the VAR parameter type, as many languages today like JS and AS3 don't allow you to change a value from inside a function unless it is a property of an object. In fact the closer you get to the Intel/ARM hardware, the more problematic many modern languages are, with their typical insistence on garbage collection instead of explicit allocation/deallocation.",

    "text": "\"Web Console is an OS X application for creating and running custom plugins that wrap command line programs in web user interfaces.\"\n\nInteresting, I have been thinking that I wanted my programming language's standard library to automatically create a UI for choosing input to the program. For example, rather than write a `--help` screen that says\n\n    Options:\n    --compress:F  Compresses the file F\n\nyou would just express options as optional named arguments to \"main\" with display-attributes attached to them, to provide the label/tooltop to show in the HTML UI, like\n\n    .entry main(\n        @label(\"File to compress:\")\n        compress: opt!filename)\n    {\n      if (compress) {\n        // TODO: whatever it was we\n        // planned to do with the file\n      }\n    }\n\nThen the HTML UI says\n\n  :white_large_square: File to compress: [*        ▾] [Browse]\n\n* this is an empty combo box with dropdown history of the user's previous choices\n\nYou could of course still use the app as a command-line app, and you could still write `--help` to be told about the `--compress` option, but the handling of `--help` would be auto-generated based on the attributes on the parameters to the entry point.\n\nMy system would also show output more visually, and support multiple entry points in a single app because why should I have to create a separate app for every entry point? That's inconvenient!\n\nWrapping arbitrary cmd-line apps sounds to me like a harder problem than building the feature into the programming language / standard library... but I don't really understand what it does just by looking at the gif in the readme.",

(You don't have to worry about the detail of how it works, but basically it works the same way recursive functions work - as a fixpoint.)

    "text": "Hi! everyone! I’m Ville Ilkkala from a Finnish startup called Valaa Technologies. We are working on an open source software development architecture called ValOS (Valaa Open System) that is based on sort of an direct manipulation programming and a globally distributed event sourcing mechanism that covers also the application source code, not just the data.\n\nI am more of an prototype user / citizen developer and I have written my first full-stack applications with the ValOS platform (I never really got my head around existing web development stacks and suffered the most with back ends and databases). Others in our team are working on the core technology and the web IDE. My prior working history includes educational game design, interaction and concept design and other things going on _around_ the code. Since getting my feet wet with programming I have also started teaching it to non-programmers using our platform.\n\nI learned about <http://futureofcoding.org|futureofcoding.org> last year when Steve sent me an bug report that our IDE doesn’t even start. :smile: He interviewed us last week and posted the video on <#CCL5VVBAN|feedback>.\n\nThe projects here seem super interesting and inspiring. I look forward to discussions, feedback and meeting new people. :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nI'm most active in LinkedIn: <https://www.linkedin.com/in/ville-ilkkala-1809b319/>",

I'm more than happy to share deeper technicalities of the stack, but glad to leave Ville do most of the talking.\nI'm a generalist and a systems builder (with all the good and the bad that comes with it), and for me ValOS is an 'exercise' of pushing the envelope of 'Distributed CRUD Event Sourcing' on several fronts as a basis of interactive content sharing and execution environment. The vision crystallized already back in late 2016 and we were able to bootstrap our own IDE 'Zero' for developing itself in late 2017 - this is the point were it ceased to be an exercise but a real thing. While the design has always centered around the base technologies of JS, HTML5 and CSS (and always will be!), the underlying paradigm is quite different. This has meant having to reinvent more wheels than we'd like. But we're on the doorsteps of having a fully functional development ecosystem with all the necessary components in place. So even I am sticking my neck out and not have Ville do all the networking... :stuck_out_tongue:",

    "text": "Hi folks! I'm Ilari, a developer at a Finnish startup Valaa Technologies (colleague of Ville and Iridian above :point_up_2:). To be a bit grandiose: We're creating what could be called a new paradigm of web coding, called ValOS (Valaa Open System). In practice it isn't that different from all the black magic things that something like Meteor framework does (automatic live updates to all displayed data between multiple users, etc). But on the background, it is a deeper rethinking of the coding model (especially distribution of code, and the frontend/backend separation), instead of piling more and more stuff on top of current stacks. Anyway, we can discuss our thing more on the channels, but I think it was relevant to intro since it's very relevant for why I am here. Because what we are doing is is directly in the frontlines of the future of coding. I'm happy to talk about this more.\n\nI've personally been coding from something like age of ten, and I've always been interested in experimenting with things. Professionally I've been a (full-stack) coder for approx. 7 years. I have an educational background in usability, and often call myself a human-geek interface. My personal passions, in addition to coding, are storytelling and games. Hopefully I'll manage to combine all these things at some point. Hopefully soon.\n\nCurrently the stuff I'm most interested in are the possibilities of ValOS resource model, combined with how quick code experimentation with ValOS is. As a coder, I want to both see and use immediate results instead of having to jump through hoops. If I hadn't encountered ValaaTech, I'd be doing similar experimentation with Meteor.",

    "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nMy name is Miguel Rochefort. I'm a software developer from Montréal, Canada. I've been traveling around Southeast Asia (Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Bali) for the past 6 months out of my 21-liter backpack.\n\nI initially got into programming at age 10, when I built my first websites (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). At 12, I started played with Python and C++. At 16, it was Visual Basic and PHP. At 18, I started learning C#, which has been my main language for the past 10 years. I then discovered Haskell, Prolog, Lisp, Smalltalk, ML, Agda, Idris, Coq, Mercury, Eve, etc. That's when I got hooked on programming language design.\n\nMy main influences are Bret Victor, Alan Kay, Douglas Engelbart, Chris Granger, Ted Nelson, Tim Berners Lee, Jef Raskin, Steve Jobs, Stephen Wolfram, Charles Simonyi, David Allen, Mathias Duarte, etc. If I could travel back in time, I would go to Xerox PARC.\n\nThe current state of software is a mess. The incidental complexity is unbelievable. Nothing changed in the past 40 years. We must have reached a local maxima.\n\nHere are some of my heuristics for the future of programming:\n\n- Using software and creating software should feel the same.\n- 80% of people should be able to program without any formal training.\n- You should be productive when programming on a 5\" phone (but the optimal interface should be VR or R).\n- Programming should not involve text files and syntax.\n- Programming by example (with direct manipulation) should be the dominant paradigm (WYSIWYG, TDD, ML dataset, Excel's Flash Fill).\n- The distinction between natural language, programming language and graphical user interface should disappear.\n- Programming is mainly a modeling problem.\n- Designing and implementing GUI by hand doesn't scale (especially once responsive design considers all of a user's preferences) and should be automated (e.g., Naked Objects).\n- The code to invoke a user (GUI) and the code to invoke a machine (API) should be identical.\n- Every function/predicate/model ever created should be instantly available to everyone.\n- Mechnical turks and AI functions should be as easy to call as a local function.\n- Fuzzy/bayesian values (e.g., \"integer between 0 and 18\") should be first class citizens, and automatically turn any deterministic functions into a fuzzy/probabilistic functions.\n- Strings should be avoided, and semantically richer types/ontologies (Email, PhoneNumber, Password, Country) should be used instead.\n\nRight now, I'm experimenting with Quantified Self. I'm trying to collect as much information about my life as I can. This starts with IoT devices, wearables, NFC tags, QR codes, cameras, audio recorders, GPS trackers, keyloggers, IFTTT, manual input, etc. Then I have to manually/automatically classify/quantify the collected data, to extract computable meaning/semantics. Ultimately, I can visualize the data, query it, infer new knowledge, make lifestyle changes to affect the output, etc. The idea is that the more we know about a user, the less we need to ask it for input (\"don't make me click\") and the less assumptions about it we need to hard code in our code base. I believe this is the first step to make coding against a user as easy as coding against an API or a database.\n\nI'm looking forward to some great discussions!",

I actually tried something similar and ended up putting the approach on its head.\n\nNow, I actually use a daily Excel spreadsheet that I reshape constantly. This no-doubt has some limitations, but it’s helped me be more concrete and think really hard about how to re-structure my data as I want to increase the useful data-collection territory.\n\nWhen I was playing with more passive / background data collection with the sensors I had at home, it was harder to iterate on the shape of the data, the view I was presented it, etc. I’ve used this Excel approach to cut a few habits out of my life :slightly_smiling_face:",

I was highly encouraged to check out Future of Coding by <@UFPPABQ7P> who designs, pitches, and develops digital products at Reaktr Inc. in NYC.\n\nI am a recent graduate from the University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC) with a bachelor's of liberal arts degree and a minor in healing arts and humanities. I leverage a dynamic background in research, R-programming, and professional nursing theory to champion high spirited teams. I am really comfortable with a variety of technologies and have an enjoyed history of wearing multiple hats.\n\nI love translating complex problems and ideas into practical tools. I think that this Slack has many bright contributors and I find this on-going dialog to be incredibly stimulating. I hope to add value to the experience of being human by incorporating what I learn within this community.\n\n-Zachary\n<mailto:mail@zrsewell.com|mail@zrsewell.com>\n+1 (917) 274-7696\n\n\n\nSidebar: I am slated to move to the NYC area on 03.28.2019 and am open to receiving advice on all things core to surviving (i.e. employment, housing, social circle building; etc.)",

    "text": "Hi everyone! My name is Robin Allison. I want to understand stuff. I studied pure math in undergrad and grad school for a year. I studied math because I could get it and obsessed over algebraic topology because more than any other subject because I couldn't get it. That wasn't good for my career but its given me a unique perspective on math and I'm grateful for that. I read Michael Nielsen's essay \"Reinventing Explanation\" which eventually let me understand Bret Victor. I came to the conclusion that my understanding was limited by the representations we used, and that by inventing my own I could better understand.\n\nI've had two personal victories, one with spectral sequences and one with the proof of the cellular boundary, in designing better representations using static media. I'm working on better representing the computation of the homology of the projective plane using the decomposition RP^2 = e^2 \\cup e^1 \\cup e^0, extending the previous techniques. I hope that these \"prototypes\" can convince other mathematicians the merits and unexplored possibilities of design, leaving aside the possibilities of dynamic media. Additionally I speculate heavily on how we interface with mathematical ideas, motivated by whats probably considered low working memory and expressive language capabilities for math.\n\nIn my experience it is extremely difficult to get other mathematicians to think about the kinds of ideas talked about here. I think part of the problem is that the solution is outside of math whereas for coding at least the solution is still code and has a historical basis in the work of Alan Kay etc.  So I hope I can hang out here until mathematics expands to consider \"design\" a part of math too. :slightly_smiling_face:",

For one, mathematics is at its core the study of pattern, and computer programming is very messy and patterns are hard to come by. Also, it doesn't lend itself to any proofs, because even a simple game like Snake can't be proven to be perfect, partly because there are subjective/aesthetic aspects to defining \"correct\" in a game. I myself am interested in measuring robustness in computer programs, especially as it relates to comparing two languages. Which language has the lowest propensity for error? Can one through the design of a language, make it much more difficult o create an error? I call it the Calculus of Error, and after using Modula-2 for example when everyone else was using C, i found that M2 programs were smaller, faster, and much more reliable, so there are intrinsic characteristics in a language which are measurable. In our industry we haven't been willing to tell the truth about the weaknesses in various languages, preferring to categorize things as mere preference. Without measurement you have fad and fashion.",

    "text": "Hi Robin, welcome to the group :wink:\nI'd be interested in your previous work, is it available online somewhere?\nMy personal story with math is that I can only really understand most things once I've build a spacial mental model for them. I think about differentiation / integration in terms of diagrams, about gradient descend as arrows pointing downwards hills and so on. I believe that these representations are incredibly useful because they leverage our well-developed spacial imagination. In my opinion, there's a huge potential for good visualizations or even interactively explorable explanations to help people think about mathematical concepts. Like <@UCGAK10LS> mentioned already, 3blue1brown's youtube channel is a very good example of this. Another good place to find cool explorable explanations is in this subreddit: <https://www.reddit.com/r/explorables/>\nFinally, I've created an interactive visualization of the Hough Transform myself some time ago: <https://fkohlgrueber.github.io/blog/hough-transform/>\nWhile the visualization by itself doesn't teach the concept very well, I believe that tools like these could be really helpful to teachers trying to show more than a couple of static examples on slides.",

    "text": "Thanks for saying hi everyone!\n<@UAL7940NM> I don't have my work documented online anywhere unfortunately. But I can try to give a quick summary here.\n\nFor the cellular boundary formula its not much. I'm essentially identifying a (conceptually) useful abstraction for this one proof and visually implementing that abstraction. That abstraction is grouping together a set of isomorphic objects for each natural number n and keeping track of the isomorphisms between them. The implementation consists of forming a new commutative diagram whose vertices/objects are now these systems of isomorphic objects and whose morphisms are now identified by specifying a particular morphism from one object of the domain system to an object of the codomain system. So now the commutative diagram reads: the map whose degree we want to take is the inclusion into the relative homology, followed by the boundary homomorphism followed by the projection onto the factor we want. This is roughly how we would understand the birds eye view of the original proof but neither this nor all the details are directly visible in the original.\n\nFor spectral sequences the representation is only a bit more substantial but the math is more difficult. For the spectral sequence of a filtered complex (of vector spaces) every vector space we will consider is uniquely isomorphic to a sub quotient of the original complex, that is, a quotient of a subspace. The relevant subspaces that we take and quotient by are linearly ordered so they can be placed on a line and then each sub quotient corresponds to a unique sub length of this line. For example if we have a filtered complex like 0=K_0 \\subset K_1 \\subset K_2 \\subset K_3= *full complex* we can put K_0 on the line at 0, K_1 on the line at 1, K_2 on the line at 2 and K_3 at the line at three (and just have the line go from 0 to 3). Then the sub quotient K_2/K_1 would correspond to the length of line going from 1 to 2 and H_*(K_2/K_1), being a sub quotient of K_2/K_1, would be signified by a smaller length line, say from 1.2 to 1.7, for a concrete mental image (although there really isn't any basis for those or any specific numbers aside from being between 1 and 2). Also in practice I would use the span from 1 to 2 for H_*(K_2/K_1) because I would rarely consider K_2/K_1 in and of itself. This is essentially what is depicted in the first picture although we are looking at H_* of a subquotient further down, namely E_{p,q}^{r-1}. Most of the sub quotients we consider are triply indexed so its a daunting task to follow the logic for the proofs of the main theorems in a single presentation let alone get a birds eye view of it all. Its the common canvas that every development of spectral sequences paints over so I can naturally compare and contrast different approaches; I can see every development occurring simultaneously/in the same visual space. Its a really cool thing! In the second picture we see two more of the same “canvases” where the small horizontal lines indicate the subquotients we are looking at and the arrows are the morphisms in the long exact sequences relating each of the subquotients.\n\nAs I'm working to extend these techniques to representing the computation of the homology of RP^2 I'm more inspired by Bret's BART Widget than any one thing in Kill Math, since Kill Math is mostly about quantitative stuff and the widget is about this complicated highly relational thing.  (OK, I need to figure out how to include pictures).",

Its just people personally reporting how they think right? Its definitely not an either-or thing for me and I'd have a hard time even saying if I favor one way of thinking over another. It depends so much on the subject and how familiar I am with the material. I think most people are guided by the visual/kinesthetic channels for thinking but need the symbolic channels for doing rigorous math. Math is at its best imo when the symbolic and visual forms are in harmony - when the visual forms guide symbolic thinking and the symbolic forms clarify our mental images. Some parts of math are visually impoverished so to make the most out of the little visualization there is, we have to pay closer attention to the symbolic forms.\n\nI guess thats really where my thinking is at, the parts of math that are nearly impenetrable to visual understanding, and how can you make the best of that situation. I believe things can be vastly improved here but I probably shouldn't begin that rant now.",

    "text": "_(frantically throws together some kind of intro before heading to meet everyone at Dynamicland)_\n\nHello there! I’m Yoz, a short bald Brit who lives in Oakland and works in SF. I’ve been lurking on this Slack for a while after enjoying a few episodes of Steve’s podcast. Some relevant bits of history:\n1. Ever since I first logged onto *LambdaMOO* in 1993, I’ve been obsessed with the potential for *shared programmable worlds*. This led me to 5 years working at *Linden Lab*, the creators/maintainers of *Second Life*, Blocksworld and Sansar, all of which are shared programmable worlds like MOO. It taught me a huge amount about the underestimated benefits and problems of these systems.\n2. I spent 4 years at *18F*, a consultancy within the US Government. It teaches departments about agile development &amp; procurement, user-centered design and open source, all with the aim of serving citizens better. Most of my time was spent both programming new systems and learning about legacy ones. *It convinced me that most of our software development was inherently a bad idea*, and that it would be better to build on no-code/low-code systems, and to focus on empowering staffers rather than automating their jobs away.\n3. I’m fascinated by debugging, with existing and new tools. I’ve given talks on debugging (see thread) and played around with creating new debugging tools.\n4. These days I’m something of a software pessimist, to the point where I’m not sure that we should be teaching kids to code at all - at least, not until we are able to sufficiently manage the complexity we create.\n5. I love amazing bug stories - see the thread for a couple, and also for my favourite computing paper.\n\nLooking forward to meeting and chatting with folks!",

    "text": "Hi Everyone,\n\nIt was great to meet some of you today at the SF/Dynamicland meetup. While I've\nbeen on Slack for a bit, I never posted to introductions so here it is.\n\nI'm a software engineer professionally and over time I've grown increasingly\ndissatisfied with the general state of affairs. It was all fun and games for a\nwhile, but then I started watching Alan Kay videos :smile:. While digging into\nhistorical ideas and banging my head against what seem to be a hard ceiling in\nmany of the tools and systems we use, I've arrived at the position that there is\na large space of possibilities that has been left unexplored while we continue\nto incrementally hammer away at the entrenched systems. I believe big leaps can\nonly happen if many established fundamental ideas are changed or replaced. For\ninstance, we store and share *information* by encoding it in a\nnon-introspectable, very low level medium (aka files) that also loses its\nconnections to related information, history and identity. We then redesign these\nfeatures over and over in various ways in different contexts. Programs as text\nfiles is another poor representation. We re-implement the same functionality and\nschemas in different siloed processes and services. It seems our language for\ninterconnection and scaling up is really poor. Much of programming deals with\nstuff that isn't really computing anything but just dealing with represenation\nchanges (e.g. parsing - doesn't change the information content). Worse, this\ntype of represenation shuffling code is tightly intermingled with the computing\ncode. We sit in front of powerful computers, and simulate them in our heads -\nhumans are simulating the general purpose simulator.\n\nSo what's an alternative? I don't know but perhaps creating a new\nPL/DB/framework to fit in a PL/DB/framework shaped hole in the current mess may not\nhelp. We need to explore ideas that are holisitic, ground up rethinking of what\ncomputing is, how the space is partitioned into concepts and artifacts (note\nfiles/filesystems, OS processes, databases, 'programs', compilers etc. are all\nmeans to an end, serving the users achieve some of their goals - what are the\ngoals and what other ways can they be expressed?). How does something like this\n'alternative substrate' or 'new material for computing' fit onto the existing\nworld? It doesn't, but my interest is more of a research exercise - how can it\nbe done, what would make it complete and self sustaining? If we have some good\nideas, we can prototype. Since this is broad and can go in all directions, I've\nbeen writing to try and clear my thoughts and keep moving forward in some way.\nIf you're interested take a look at <https://shalabh.com/programmable-systems/>",

In fact, I think it’s vital. So yes, it’s over-dramatic of me to say maybe we shouldn’t teach kids to code _at all_. Perhaps it’s more useful (but more boring) to teach in terms of benefits &amp; dangers rather than “look, you can make anything!”",

    "text": "Coltrane ranges from super mellow to unbearable atonality/harshness. The album he did with Johnny Hartman is one of the most mellow records you will ever hear. There is also a compilation called the \"gentle side of JC\" that is particularly pleasant. His wife Alice Coltrane was no slouch either, and she made a lot of spacey harp music at the same time as he was doing his stuff. Coltrane got into heroin and then kicked it so there an intensity in his work, depending on his physical state, that is quite extreme. And of course you are getting McCoy Tyner who is super great. Tyner still performs a bit, he is one of the only survivors of that era. sorry i misspelled Durufle earlier. He wrote very little music, but his Requiem i believe is even nicer than Faure's. And also worth checking out is Cannonball Adderly &amp; Nancy Wilson. She was just a kid at the time, her first record, and it is spectacular. Youth is so beautiful.",

    "text": "Hi Wouter, welcome! We chatted a bit about Lobster's `while` sometime back. I still find Lobster one of the most promising languages, just don't have time to explore or work with it :smile:. One really interesting feature is the typing (is there a name for this? verified duck typing? flow based?) The ability to write fairly flexible code with only a  few annotations, and the compiler will verify (whole program analysis?) that there is no AttributeError. Specifically each branch is specialized for invocation with different types. It appears you end up with Python like semantics and code patterns, except AttributeErrors are checked at compile time? Even the null checks are very nice because if something can be null or a number, you can just do\n```\nif a:\n  a += 1\n```\nAnd the compiler wont complain. No 'unpacking sum type' is necessary, and no danger of accidentally doing `a+=1` in an unchecked branch (compiler will complain). This is kind of a sweet spot between the current mainstream static and dynamic typing ideas. Is this a correct understanding of the features?\n\nWhare areas of Lobster are under active development?\n\n(For folks interested in the type system see <https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aardappel/lobster/master/lobster/docs/type_checker.html>)",

Or rather, creating in a way that makes creations easy for others to appreciate/remix/contribute to.\n3. Keeping a closely-coupled group on a single page about what they are seeing.\n\nAll three directions seem complementary, in that there's no reason they can't steal ideas from each other. The eventual goal seems like a workspace that supports groups spanning a spectrum of sizes (including individuals), and that is easy to export from one group to another.",

It's like the difficulty of understanding the implementation of some large system, but now many times harder.\n\nIt's easy to think this difficulty is comparable to the difficulty of getting to Oakland, or of getting invited into Dynamicland. But I think it's orders of magnitude harder. It's the \"essential complexity\" here.\n\nAs you point out, there are two ways to go about it:\n\na) Emphasize automation first, and try to create a single space with bespoke hardware and software in hopes that it automatically facilitates a wide range of conversations.\n\nb) Emphasize the facilitation, and hope that the variables introduced by the facilitators don't make it too intractable to make generalities about the approach. Then hope that the lessons learned are amenable to automation.\n\nBoth seem hard.\n\n(Thanks for reminding me of this forum. I'd signed up back when it was called tbd.cool.)",

    "text": "Hey folks, I'm Jeremy. I'm based in Ottawa, ON, Canada. Been listening to the podcast off and on for a while, don't remember how I found it.\nI've been programming since I was 4 years old using BASIC on a Commodore Vic-20. My career as a developer has been kind of all over the map, but the relevant detail for this crowd is that I got very excited about DSLs in the early 2000s and went to work at Intentional Software for five and a half years (2006-2011).\nI also run a game-making community at <http://glorioustrainwrecks.com|glorioustrainwrecks.com>, where the guiding ethos is to be creative and expressive without gatekeeping or judgement about your choice of tools, game mechanics, or subject matter. Tiny, weird, and personal games are the norm, to the extent there is a norm. Hyper-accessible game-making tools like Klik &amp; Play and Twine deserve to be talked about in the same breath as Hypercard IMO.\nIn general, my main interest at this point is empowering ordinary people; computing should be understandable, accessible, personal, collaborative, and in the direct control of the people who use it. When I was a kid, I was surrounded by tools that were designed to be learnable by people who had never touched a keyboard, and resources that encouraged me that understanding computers was not only possible, but fun and rewarding. To the extent that improving programming can advance that goal, I am on board.",

You defined a schema for your language, we gave you an IDE, which you could progressively enhance with custom notations and functionality.\n_Everything_ in the system was built around tree transformations - the entire editor was a series of compiler passes from domain code to an editor language to a layout language to a graphics language - and all transformations had rich mappings between their input and output, so you could connect a pixel on the screen back to its source. \nI spent most of my time working on persistence and version control - merging of trees based on full edit history, unobtrusively modelling conflicts, etc. \nWe had a couple of pilot customers that we built workbenches for, to prove out the approach - iirc we demoed one based around administrating pensions a few times.

Unfortunately I haven't spent much time actually using it, so I can't really comment on specific differences except very superficially, ie.

I don't know if I misunderstood something, am misremembering, or if they've fixed that since, but such an edit would have impossible with Intentional's representation; names were a property of the thing, not references to the thing. This was core; you could have any number of names assigned to something - i18n for your variables, both short and long names, etc. At one point we added \"friendly\" names to some of our core language features, which were originally named with Hungarian notation :)",

    "text": "I find the whole conversation about changelogs, and fancy source control to be depressing. If Tolstoy who wrote War &amp; Peace, one of the greatest books ever written entirely in longhand, can create a complex, threaded story, without worrying about backtracking, why is it that people are so interested in what the code used to be? That isn't productivity, source control is about damage control from people breaking stuff who can't understand the implications of the changes they are making, because stuff is too tightly interconnected. In my system i am striving for super-compartmentalization, so that changes don't ripple throughout the system, and have unseen, unpredictable consequences. CSS is my poster child for unpredictable results from small changes. I think CSS is the most devilish thing ever devised in computers, one of the primary motivations for my development efforts is my extreme distaste for CSS.\n\nAnyway, if you can author sequentially, and the computer turns it into recursion, and depth-first/breadth-first searches, and automatic sorting, with no joins or tricky concepts, it should be possible for individuals to write large products with no stress.\n\nI always found that programs with no branches and a straight down flow were easy to program. So the goal is to have zero IF statements, and linear flow. Let the computer do the tricky bit of  re-sequencing. That is the goal.",

    "text": "Good morning and hello all. My name is Jason Priestley, I'm a bay area software developer. I have one big idea for the future of software. It's hard to describe because it either sounds vague or trivial or incomprehensible depending on how I describe it, so I'll describe it in a few ways, and perhaps the sum will give a better sense of things.\n\nMy idea is to unify programmer and user. Seen from the programmer's side, this means an IDE that provides the discoverability and rich graphical UI that user's enjoy. Seen from the user's side, this means that their walled-garden \"apps\" are now part of one big app, they are unknowingly editing code by clicking buttons, and there is a smooth transition between graphical UI and code.\n\nMy idea is to bring the Lisp REPL into the graphical era. Read and Print are text-based primitives. The modern equivalent is a graphical UI that can extend and edit itself. The extension method may resemble Reader macros, but instead of taking over Read at certain syntax, it takes over the whole UI.\n\nMy idea is to make data into code. Lisp made code into data - a function declaration is also a linked list. Data into code means that whenever you are operating on data - editing a TODO list say - you are literally editing code in one big program. Editing your TODO list is a specialized UI that does the exact same thing as opening the TODOs variable in your code editor and typing out your changes manually.\n\nMy idea is to make a universal editor. Instead of one editor and many apps you have one editor that can be changed and customized to take on any behavior.\n\nMy idea is to complete the idea behind Emacs. People joke that Emacs is an OS, that you can do anything in Emacs. I take these jokes seriously. An extensible editor should be our OS, but emacs is too ad-hoc and too tied to text buffers to really suffice. Emacs, but the primitive operations are more low-level UI constructs, and graphical from the start.",

    "text": "Lamdu, while at the moment more focused on lower level “real programming”, also shares the same idea in our “grander vision”..\n\nTo put it into different terms with an example - suppose that a user is editing a video - instead of using an opaque application Final Cut etc, they’ll be editing in a similar video timeline UI, which is just a domain-specific syntax-sugar for calling the appropriate video editing combinator. But an important part of any such projectional syntax sugar is that it doesn’t limit you and allows you also, if you wish, to also perform edits that change the code to anything really, even if it no longer fits the timeline pattern.. So that this timeline-like interface is for concatenating a bunch of videos in a literal list, and then the user wants to concatMap the list so that each video repeats twice - then they could do that but it just won’t have the timeline interface anymore, unless someone creates a sugar for that more complicated pattern too.\n\nBut to do that, I think that we need to start with a good ground to stand on. That’s why we’re starting with the more lower-lever programmingy stuff.\n\nIIUC Unison also has this in their grand vision, which is kind of what Paul Chiusano refers to when he talks about “UX derived from type theory”. And so Hazel too probably shares the same vision.",

    "text": "&gt;  IDE that provides the discoverability\nYep—current IDEs could do a much better job here!\n&gt; Data into code means that whenever you are operating on data - editing a TODO list say - you are literally editing code in one big program.\nThis is called “programming by demonstration”. It has pros and cons. The hard bit is “inference”: figuring what abstract operation the user intended by the single demonstrated example. DM me if you want a reference list. At the most basic level you can just dump a list of commands in order to a file (like a bash history) and not try to be smart, but these sorts of programs are not the highest quality. In Sketch-n-Sketch we’ve been playing around with an output-directed refactoring approach, but it’ll take some work to generalize that to general purpose programs. (c.f. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JcKnJyufD8>)\n&gt; My idea is a structure editor that operates on a unified database of code, shared by all users.\nI understand this is also <@UC25EFSJC>’s vision for Hazel (<http://hazel.org/>). He uses the term “Wikipedia” of code where everything is editable by everyone.\n&gt; The structure editor is written to be highly extensible by the basic operation of matching on syntax and taking over the UI at that point. Users can register syntax-editors, share them etc.\nAgreed! My current understanding is that the matching might be better done by types, actually. Hazel is moving in this direction, I believe.\n&gt; An extensible editor should be our OS\nAgreed! OSes need revisiting—they don’t provide good enough interfaces between disparate code elements.\n&gt; today’s heavy, monolithic UIs would disappear\nWe can hope! But I don’t think “everything is code” gets you all the way there. Even within a single language, there’s a big interface problem between software components and you’ve got to have a story for that. The problem is that it’s hard to (a) understand what kind of data the other source provides, (b) figure out the API to get it, and then (c) mangle the data into the form you need it.",

Welcome, aboard!\n\nMeta question: How does it feel to get flood of responses like \"Heyy it's pretty much I am working on.\"?\nIt's quite fascinating how similar conclusions people get more or less independently.\n\n-Consider is it code editor where the code is also data or is it \"just\" a data editor where the code is one possible domain (I prefer last one).\n    -I am really excited about empowering users for more complex use cases with Unix like reusable tools where classic GUIs are not powerful enough.\n    -A dream from an application developer point of view would be that you just describe part of your API and you would get super powerful UI cheaply.\n-I think some typing is required and for free data editing, I think it shouldn't be nominal.\n-One of my current problems is that what should a code execution look like? You can show a representation of computation result (diagram, SmallTalk GUI) and look for specific element and code behind it or the complete opposite where you can see partial results inside of your code. Or something completely different? You sided this slightly with REPL but it's pretty vague.\n&gt; Read and Print are text-based primitives.

Plenty of people had  Emacs available for free, they threw it aside the minute they got to see WordStar, WordPerfect, MS Word, etc. for text editing, because 99.999% of people will never write a Lisp program in their text editor. Look at Postscript; it is a domain specific language that perfectly describes static pages, but never really handled colored font rendering well, and is not convenient at all for graphical interactive work because it lacks an event model. Most applications do not need dynamic code. 99.99% of mobile apps have no dynamic code, and they work just fine. Dynamic code is painful to debug, and the more dynamic the language, the more skill and restraint it requires. Emacs is un-ergonomic, and would lose against almost any other editor you can mention in an A-B comparison preference test with new users. Why build a cathedral on a mud pit? Sorry to be the splash of cold water, but ask yourself, why would George RR Martin, who is very rich, still be using WordStar? Was it the convenience of the CTRL-S, CTRL-D,  keys etc. to move the cursor, so that one never leaves the home row? The ergonomics of WordStar were tremendous, and no product since can beat it for simple typing input. Really since programming is a human task, study the masterworks of the past, things that were beloved and insanely popular in their day, rather than some elitist tool that Project Mac at MIT was so fond of.",

    "text": "Feels great to get all this feedback. Most people I've talked to about this don't understand what I'm getting at. It's super exciting to see other people with similar vision.\n\nI'm by no means opposed to static types, but for my prototype I'm trying to cut out any work that isn't essential to embodying my vision and static types don't make the cut. They seem to considerably complicate structure editing and the specific benefits I'm after don't rely on them. That said, I agree that there are considerable synergies between type systems and structure editing, so I can see how that could be a core component of some of your projects.\n\nNiko your point about getting a UI from an API is a really good one and gets at part of the core value of my approach. Suppose I write a library and API for image editing. The user gets nothing from this. To expose the API to the user I have to do additional work for every object and function in the UI.\n\nIn my system, the user can immediately use the whole API. The UI can be specialized gradually to add more friendly interactions, like dragging to create a rect. Think of how in emacs, the generic text-editing interface lives alongside buffers that are specialized to show a bespoke UI with specific commands, e.g. magit.\n\nEdward a few points. First of all I appreciate the critique. A few points. First of all code in my system is not text but trees, and since any data format can be encoded in a tree you could write MS Word in my system if you wanted to. However I do see people writing much less monolithic apps in my system, and bringing the ui muh closer to an IDE in many ways, so this does not really invalidate the body of your critique.\n\nFirst time users and casual users will never want powerful software and should not be forced to use it. They aren't the target audience for my system, if everyone switches to my system I imagine they will still be using bespoke UIs per task with little hint that they are editing code (my system can perfectly well embed such experiences). The target for my system is the \"power user\" ranging up to the programmer.\n\nNow if you look at the activities of such power users, in apps like photoshop, word, or excel, they are in fact spending a lot of their time on the manipulation of abstract data. For example, layer management and smart objects in photoshop, track changes, macro and template systems, formulas in excel, files and sheets ... this is all like a pidgin programming language, but built up inside each program at enormous cost, following no overall principles, and lacking interoperability.\n\nI don't disagree that crafted, graphical interactions are vastly superior to old-school UI like emacs, and beloved for good reason. I neither want to force users to code or force programmets to drag-and-drop etc. Where I want to change things is the user-programmer dynamic. Right now you have your nice WIMP interface to edit you document, and if something isn't covered in that interface then you call up a programmer, who opens the same program in an entirely different interface, adds the feature almost blindly to the interface, compiles it and sends you a new version. In my system you would first of all already be able to do your new task by dropping down into a lower level of the interface; and then you could save that code into the program in the same interaction.",

We're both interested there.\n\nIt sounds like your approach is best suited to domains that have obvious visualizations, particularly UIs and graphics, but perhaps also sound. Do you care about how the great APIs you mentioned are arrived at? Is that with your ideal system, or do you assume they're built outside your system?\n\nOne problem the current stack struggles with is the proliferation of languages within even text-based programs. As a programmer building something much simpler than the sort of thing you're envisioning, I often find myself needing to know many different languages, each with their own syntax and semantics. Often I'm learning these on demand, and discovering the depths of my ignorance at the worst possible time. I think your system will also have this problem. Do you disagree or have a sense for how your more powerful UI will avoid this problem? It feels like precious experience available to learn from.",

Simpler systems have been built, they've failed in the market. It's really an economic problem - good code comes from shared efforts, profits come from walled gardens. I have ideas for how to fix this as well, which would get into the details of what a \"wikipedia for code\" would mean and who would pay for it, but it's not the focus of my current efforts (it's a lot harder to prototype and prove an economic system with limited personal resources versus a programming system)\n\nStill, if I expose the awful complexity of application programming to the user, no matter how slick my packaging, then this will be a non-starter; so I'm left having to build some kind of simple and comprehensible alternative to the current tangle.",

    "text": "Hi everyone! My name is Nicolas and I live in Toulouse, France.\n\nI love coding since I first try it (maybe at 11) and do it for a living for more than twenty years (as a computer scientist and a scientist in remote sensing imaging). I like discovering and experimenting new things in computer science. My recent interests are WebAssembly, Vue.js and Rust. Several years ago I cofound \"la Compagnie du Code\", an organization in Toulouse that organizes workshops to give childrens the opportunity to code and practice creative computing and computationnal thinking. My main tool for that is MIT's Scratch.\n\nI am convinced that for now programming is a uneccessary complicated and I am wondering how this activity can evolve to permit more people to do it, even those that are not professionnal programmers but that can benefit from a bit of programming every now and then. My guess is that one key thing to bring more people to code is visual coding. So I am here, maybe because on my search on visual programming resources I once heard of Bret Victor, then later found some reference to him in \"Future of Coding\" and find this initiative very inspiring! :slightly_smiling_face: I know I have *lots* of stuff to read and discuss to learn what people have expermients in that field...\n\nSo my vision is a visual coding platform on top of web standards. I know there are lots of visual programming semantics that have been invented/experimented since several decades, and it is not new to try to bring people to programming this way, and none has really succeeded (some more than others, but none has became a standard or is widely used). But I am convinced that there is some stuff to experiment! I have started to read some content of <http://futureofcoding.org|futureofcoding.org> and what I have read so far is very close to my vision, in particular in <https://futureofcoding.org/about#mission> where lots of points I should have wrote myself, except that I focus less on low level language, which is important, but for me the first step is the visual parts.\n\nTo conclude, I hope my trip in this slack and with the \"Future of Coding\" community will make me challenge my thoughts, discover some new inspiring visions and people, and experiment more on that field!",

I'm a mathematician of a similar age as <@U6KQ2S410> and have programmed since the tail end of the punched card era, mostly at a low level - digging myself upwards from designing and building assemblers, debuggers, compilers, and interpreters to graphical editors (2D and 3D), to web design (frontend and backend).\n\nI taught Maths and then Computer Science at a Cambridge, UK sixth form and saw the introduction of the BBC Micro. This led me eventually to quitting teaching and writing software for the first ARM-based computer (the Acorn Archimedes) having borrowed one for a weekend to port the virtual machine for an APL interpreter (which could also run on the BBC Micro).\n\nThe (minimal) original website for my company is still up and running (<http://www.acecomp.demon.co.uk/>) and there's a brief mention of some earlier work on the Binary Dinosaurs site (<http://www.binarydinosaurs.co.uk/Museum/icl/tcheal.php>). My company merged with two other small UK software houses who produced a HyperCard-like programming system (Genesis) for the Archimedes. I am currently employed by an NLP specialist - designing a new web-based front-end for their product. I have also recently been teaching CS again, now that the UK syllabus has returned to something more like the one I taught in the 1980s.\n\nI have been working on attempts to improve programming itself for about 25 years, mostly due to a random thought in about 1993 which means I can no longer program without thinking \"This could be a lot easier...\" every time I hit a key. I've set myself a deadline for September to produce something a bit more public, as a self-imposed incentive. I've probably now gone down most dead-ends, so I'm hoping that failure experience will eventually pay off.",

Originally from northern California, I spent 20 years in Europe (mainly Switzerland, Czech Republic and most recently southern France) and I'm currently living in Boise, Idaho.\nI used to be part of the 2020 group in San Francisco which has similar discussions and is paired with the Future of Programming meetups in the Bay Area (<https://www.meetup.com/Future-of-Programming>).  My big, long-term project is called Kayia which is an attempt to layer the spreadsheet model onto a declarative language, if that makes any sense.  I would link to the site for that, but since it's undergoing a lot of changes, it just has a stub for now.   I'm looking forward to joining in on the discussions!",

    "text": "Hello everyone! PhD student in CS but have been coding for around 15 years. I've done hundreds of things as I was always \"following the new trends\" during all this time. As of today, I'm very into JIT compilers and WebAssembly, also my PhD is on Scientific Visualization with an application to Biology. These days I'm going through some kind of early-adult-life crisis, I had a daughter 3 years ago and that changed my perspective on life completely. I used to be a very chill person and didn't worry about \"monetizing\" my career. Now I have bills to pay and I want to find ways to turn my talent into profit. This has been very difficult as my network is mostly scientists and we are very disconnected from /the real world/. I've tried to join some university incubators but had no success (I could tell the story later). I'm mainly looking to network with people to either 1. get into a new venture/startup and help getting it off the ground or 2. find a nice job to go to after I finish my PhD. Don't hesitate to message me if you want to talk about pretty much anything (I read a lot about many things, not only science related). I've been reading HN (and other stuff) daily since 2009, so if you just want to talk industry gossip is cool for me. Also greetings everyone :smile:!",

    "text": "Hi all, I am an art historian turned philosopher and historian of computing – . I was lucky enough to get a permanent research position at a time when I was starting to despair a bit and still feel as one of the most lucky persons when I realize I have this job. It gave me a new kind of freedom which I didn’t have in previous academic positions; and it took me quite a while to realize that.  I am very much engaged with retracing and rendering transparent through history where we are now with computing technology – as so many others; I worry a lot about this broad and disconnected field; I very much like an approach of asking rather basic questions (I guess that is the philosopher in me) which, at first sight, almost seem trivial but once one starts to dig a bit, seem to be quite hard. One main question I am currently focusing on is: What is a (computer) program? This is the guiding question of a research project I am coordinating and which involves historians, philosophers, computer scientists and some programmers. Note: the choice for \"program\" and not software; code; algorithm; etc is not arbitrary – I think it kind of comprises/implied these other notions. If anyone of you might be interested in this or anything else that is losely or strictly related to history and philosophy of computing and programs, please do share your thoughts/concerns/etc with me. Also: I am currently starting to collect answers from as many people as possible to the main question above and I would be happy to receive some from you too – best wishes, L",

Back in my philosophy days I thought it might be interesting to run the same kind of \"multiple realizability\" arguments that you find in the philosophy of mind to argue for the non-reducibility of programs to, eg. patterns of activity in the hardware. These days I'm in the typed functional programming camp and like to think of programs as proofs, via the Curry-Howard isomorphism. So the next question is \"what is a proof?\".",

Most professional developers know shockingly little about the history of the field, and don't care to know. As a result, there is a skewed view that newer is better, and things of the past are irrelevant or more primitive or crude form of the present. Ideas from the past are widely forgotten and reinvented every decade or two, and a lot of meaning is lost and terms redefined.\n\nThe playlist I'm sharing here mainly focuses on this aspect of software history. A few of the videos focus more on a particular programming topic, but paint a historical picture in doing so.\n\nSome of the videos with Jim Coplien focus a lot on the history of software *practices* (e.g. Agile &amp; Scrum)",

    "text": "The Christopher Alexander video does not explain much about software history, but is itself a key event in software history. Alexander was looking to restore physical architecture to its more humanistic roots (find his video \"spaces for the soul\" on YouTube for more info). His \"pattern language\" theory was actually picked up by the software community, sparking a \"patterns\" movement which essentially sought to find patterns to build software that was more humane and useful to people. The founders of this movement formed \"The Hillside Group\" (find their website).\n\nHowever, \"patterns\" in software quickly devolved into ways to deal with problems in the code (e.g. like shifting from how to build a kitchen or entrance or living room that promotes togetherness while respecting personal space ... to how best to nail drywall to a wood frame). The change was solidified by a book published by 4 authors commonly known as \"The Gang of Four\" (GoF) (look it up, it's not hard to find them). The book and it's more mechanical idea of \"patterns\" still today forms a foundational part of modern software ideology.\n\nWith this flop, some key figures in software (many from the Hillside Group) sought other ways to make software more humanistic, and as a result we have \"Agile\" (see the \"Agile Manifesto\", also easy to find).\n\nThe Christopher Alexander video marks his address to the software community after this patterns movement had gained traction, and the Gang of Four book had taken its course. He talks a lot about his work, and then addresses the disparagement between it and what software has done with it.",

    "text": "Hello, I’m the CEO of <http://www.hyperfiddle.net/> which is a FOC startup currently based in Philadelphia. Hyperfiddle basically takes the Clojure/Datomic information model and extends it through to user interfaces. While the technology is interesting, we think a large part of the work is forming a strategy to get adoption at scale (a smooth path from 0 to 1 to 100 to 100k) and also figuring out an economic model to fund the work.\n\nWe are bullish on Clojure because Clojure satisfies the criteria of “smooth adoption path” and has a lot of deeply interesting properties, such as the cost of porting Clojure to a new platform is within about a man-year of effort. Clojure on N platforms makes it possible to build distributed systems across platforms with shared information model, data structures and code. A unified/holistic model. So while Clojure is certainly not perfect, it is designed for real-world usage and makes practical compromises to achieve growth. We see Hyperfiddle as just one component of a self-organizing movement which is larger than any one project or company funding 100% of the work.",

There is even one gist with step by step instructions that doesn't work at all if you follow them, because of some wrong syntax when calling clang.

    "text": "&gt; One main question I am currently focusing on is: What is a (computer) program?\n\nBrilliant question. To me the program concept is turning out be something of a diversion. We think we work with one program mostly but in reality we work with a cacophony of them and other non-programmy things (shared libraries - are they inside my program or outside?). Roughly a program seems like a static description of some automated **process**. I'd argue that the processes of interest mostly span slices across multiple such definitions. I'm trying to focus away from the idea of a program and instead think about the larger context of the 'system'. See <https://shalabh.com/programmable-systems/systems-not-programs.html>",

Strat is this odd thing that connects functions together within the cloud and lets users represent services and events at a very high level.

    "text": "Hi, all! My name is Nathan Schulzke. I first started programming as a 10-year-old with a copy of Macromedia Flash. Building silly Flash games as a pre-teen doesn't look like much of an educational experience to typical modern educators, but I firmly attribute my success in learning math, logic, and linguistics to early experiments in programming. Because coding was so foundational for me, it has always been surprising and disappointing how few kids get into programming, and how many CS college students find little to no enjoyment in it.\n\nTwo summers ago I taught at a coding camp, which proved to be a turning point for me. I was able to observe in others the same transformation that I went through upon learning programming. I watched kids who thought they were dunces realized they could make the computer do _anything_, which gave them hope and confidence that wasn't there before. But I also observed that the programming curriculum we were given actually got in they way of learning, and only the few kids who were able to ignore the curriculum actually learned to love to code.\n\nThis observation led me to read everything I could find on teaching programming to kids. I read Seymour Papert, Alan Kay, and Brett Victor, and a philosophy of programming education began to take shape. I began to feel that programming could be used to solve critical educational deficits in a lot of kids, if we can only lift our vision above the C-style programming model and treat computing as the wide and varied creative field it can be. I thought I was alone in this line of thinking until the Hillel Wayne podcast ended up on Hacker News. I'm thrilled to find a group so invested in all of my favorite authors, and am excited to learn more!",

There is no question that better languages can drastically simplify programming, and that a much larger number of personality types can enjoy programming once this grand simplification occurs. I find at present, programming is restricted to people who could do a 5000 piece jigsaw puzzle. That takes a very special kind of persistence, patience, and strong pattern recognition skills. Most puzzles sold are in the 300 / 500 / 1000 piece sizes, and many stores don't even stock a 5000 piece jigsaw.",

My guess is most serious applications that a senior might design look more like spreadsheets, or an ECA system, and wouldn't necessarily have the primitives to make compelling games or interactive art\\stories that more kid focused environments like scratch or etoys encourage.  This comes back to <@UCUSW7WVD>'s comment that simplifying programming language doesn't help much, you need to build environments that empower people",

    "text": "A local nonprofit that works closely with the school districts in my state recruited me and others as college mentors to lead a new coding camp, with one college mentor per class of about 30 kids. They gave us a curriculum provided by a local boot camp. The result was that the entire 9-week program was dedicated to having each kid build the same website, with a bit of flexibility for styling. I had to fight the system to give the kids in my classroom freedom to pursue the projects they actually wanted to work on.\n\nThe perception among educators seems to be that because programming is considered a STEM field, it can be effectively taught like a math class. The teacher presents the material, the kids are assigned homework problems, and the teacher grades the resulting work. This is not how anyone that I know who loves programming learned to code. In my experience, coding is much better learned the way an artist learns to paint or a writer to write. Rather than giving the kids homework assignments specially crafted to be easy to grade, we should be giving them freedom to pursue whatever projects interest them, and provide guidance and support in helping them to choose projects that are achievable and will stretch them. I find that the things I learn actually stick with me if I discover them for myself.",

But the specific project I’ve been mulling over and experimenting with is using fully automated testing (like fuzzing) of interactive applications to collect execution information to support the programmer. I imagine a system where you can get a map of what the application actually does (intentional or not), and then you can explore down into _why_ it does those things.\n\nBut it’s a side project, so maybe more dream than reality, but I’m sure I’m not alone :wink:",

    "text": "I don't think coding bootcamps are a good place for new languages, because most of the camps i have seen are focused on getting people into commercial readiness of some kind and training on something that is bleeding edge would seem disappointing to the students because when they get out they will be likely compelled to use some very conventional language, as few beginners have design or language authority. Only powerful, established talent can buck the system and inject a new language, or the sole practitioner who doesn't care what anyone else is doing. After working on a gigantic C program for a year with 12 others, i was sick of the contamination and error injection caused by people changing interfaces, and sought a better language, and settled on Modula-2, which was so commercially productive for me i kept using it for 20 years. This is why smaller projects have very profitably used less popular languages. Even ancient technologies like LISP will sometimes show up inside products; in the hands of a skilled practitioner anything is possible.\n\nthat being said, it would be a lot more fun, and a lot easier, to train people in a bootcamp using one of the new languages which drastically reduces the total amount one has to learn. With a total of 20 function calls you should be able to build a chess program for an iPad and a web browser. And omniscient debugging makes it a lot less frustrating. This is the double whammy coming, which will be dramatic moment for the software industry; the combination of simplification with a major reduction in what i call the frustration of not being able to reverse an effect back to its cause.",

What I care about is scientific data and models in my work, and e-mails, e-books, contacts, music etc. otherwise. A computer for me is a tool to work with digital information, with the information being more important than the tool. Much of today's digital information is held hostage by code. This covers proprietary data formats, overly complex or undocumented data formats, and information absorbed by (and hidden in) software source code. For the specific case of scientific models, I have written a whole article about this issue: <https://f1000research.com/articles/3-101/v2>.",

    "text": "Hi Konrad! A lot of us actually share a similar sentiment: that a computer should be able to be whatever people make it to be, and one should have full ownership &amp; authorship of their own data, artifacts, and tools -- and in the ways that make the most sense (e.g. not just by code &amp; programming).\n\nThe \"computer\" is a universal simulation machine that can be made to do, model, or simulate just about anything -- but somehow fails to actually provide that capability to the one using it! That's like if all scissors came in that hard plastic packaging that's darn near impossible to open without scissors!\n\nImagine a material that can be manipulated to take-on any physical properties or shape, but can *only* be manipulated by tools made from that same material. Even with only very crude tools to start with, it would not be hard make better tools (including better tool-making-tools) to whatever level of exactness one desires. -- But that's *essentially* what \"software\" is: the most dynamic and moldable substance possible, and created and manipulated by other software.\n\nI'm working on a tool that explores such an approach, by serving as an editor &amp; viewer for software entities, including its own innards -- and thus can mold anything (including itself) in whatever way is best.",

Unfortunately, to define data we need data types (or data formats etc.) and to define behaviour we need code. And these two constructs depend on each other: code manipulates data (if we don’t need that, then we don’t need computers). So helping scientists work with their data fundamentally comes down to helping them work with data types/formats and code. Sometimes that code is hidden in UI widgets (and whether this is a good thing is hotly debated). So I focus a lot on how to design programming languages and tools because working with code is simply a nightmare in today’s world. I’m not targeting scientists in particular, but I am working on how to make modelling (and comprehending) systems easier, which is something that scientists need.",

    "text": "Hi Drew,\nre: what type of database, from the readme:\n&gt; relational (has tables with typed columns and foreign keys)\n\nre: tree-structured queries; they are GraphQL-style, but with a more SQL-like syntax. Here's an example from the readme, slightly reindented:\n```MANY blog_posts {\n  id, title, body,\n  comments: MANY comments {\n    id, body,\n    author: ONE users {\n      name\n    },\n  }\n}```\n…and yes, as shown in the readme, the response is a whole tree as JSON.\n\nre: how to do live queries: this code path: :stuck_out_tongue: <https://github.com/vilterp/treesql/blob/master/pkg/live_queries.go#L94-L101>\nBasically, when a live query is first run, it saves \"listeners\" in a special data structure in memory. Later, when writes come in, we look up those listeners, find live queries interested in that write, and push it out to them.\n\nThere's nothing that makes it fundamentally easier to do that in a document store than in a relational database. CockroachDB (where I work) is built on top of a key-value store, as are document DBs, and we have one of the building blocks of live queries: changefeeds (<https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/create-changefeed.html>), a way of getting a feed of writes going into the DB. The tricky part is mapping these writes to the queries that would be interested in them — i.e. \"a comment with blog post id 5 was inserted =&gt; these 11 queries covered blog post 5, so they'd want to know about this\"",

Frustrating. <@UCGAK10LS> My focus is the same as yours: code and data.

    "text": "Hi there! I'm Sébastien and am currently based in Montréal (moving to Wellington, NZ in a few months). I've been interested in PL design since late 90s and have created a few transpilers ([Sugar](<https://github.com/sebastien/sugar>), [Sugar 2](<https://github.com/sebastien/sugar2>), [PAML](<https://github.com/sebastien/paml>), [PCSS](<https://github.com/sebastien/pcss]> as well as underlying tools/libraries like [LambdaFactory](<https://github.com/sebastien/lambdafactory>) and [Libparsing](<https://github.com/sebastien/libparsing>)). My background is primarily in software engineering, but I also have studied design and have worked at the intersection of both creating interactive data-visualizations and data-rich interfaces at [FFunction](<https://ffctn.com>)\n\nI'm currently working on two PL-related projects at the moment: Curved, a visual editor for the Curv Language by Doug Moen (who's also on this forum) and TLang, a language for incremental tree processing to build compilers, build systems, reactive user interfaces, databases and other applications that rely heavily on a graph structure.\n\nI'm very interested in the topics of visual programming and how programming languages/paradigms shape our mental model, and I'm particularly interested in the technical topics of parsing, abstract program model/program representation and data structure synthesis (all of which, you can guess, are quite useful in building modern compilers!).",

    "text": "Hello all. I figure it’s time I should formally introduce myself. I’m a programmer in Virginia who’s eagerly looking for the future of coding. My dream is to unlock the power of computing for non-programmers. I’ve seen this done particularly well in Dynamics CRM, Microsoft Excel, and in the now-abandoned Eve language. I’m particularly interested in logic programming, query languages (like Datalog), and the semantic web, so naturally I pay close attention to Dustin Getz’ Hyperfiddle project. Clojure is my weapon of choice, but I’m developing an appreciation for static types and the expressivity they bring, and am interested in exploring formal methods and dependently-typed languages like Idris. I also have an avid interest in how philosophy bears on computation, and how a humane philosophy can work itself out into humane software. I’m very grateful to have found this group. Here’s to the future of coding :clinking_glasses:",

Developers need to focus on what matters most: business-logic and not the plumbing, deployments, and complexities that plague application development today. Application Storytelling is top-level language that seamlessly connects microservices and functions in a serverless way. Because \"serverless\" is just an abstraction after-all. It's time we amplify development with something we all want: glue code.",

I am still new to a lot of this stuff so I look forward to learning a lot from the more experienced members of this group.

It seemed like the place I should be while I think hard about how to solve today's challenges of web coding &amp; design in my role as Product Manager for :fire::fox_face::hammer_and_wrench: Firefox DevTools.\n\nMy goals are to make devs more productive and guide their work to create an open, fast &amp; compatible web, accessible to everyone. I like to explore topics around logging, step debugging, logpoints/tracepoints, time travel debugging :male-scientist::skin-tone-3:, remote debugging, worker debugging, etc. (If you are interested in exploring DevTools, discussing ideas with the team or following development, we got <https://devtools-html-slack.herokuapp.com/)> .",

To see the effect of a code change, the application must be \"relaunched\" -- that is, its entire world is destroyed, and rebuilt again from scratch. How can we \"create by reacting\", continuously changing the code and seeing continuous effects in the flow and data, when there is no continuity between the application's state before and after the change?\n\nIf so, in my experience the potential upside of a programming language designed from the ground up to incorporate this sort of thing is not worth sacrificing the enormous amount of investment and interest in languages like Python and JS.",

This something Jon Blow &amp; Alan Kay talk about, as well as others, and I tend to agree. To elaborate, any new innovation or idea has to work “at scale” relatively quickly. Meaning, learnable programming type visualization and iteration may be doable for basic examples (like the ones BV uses), but supporting that type of understanding and iteration would be almost impossible for the actual system that Python code would live in. At work, our Python code runs as part of the django framework (so features would have to work there), some jobs run async in celery, then they talk to different data sources like Postgres, then all of this spaghetti mess lives in containers, which exist in pods in kubernetes, and we have API’s on top of kubernetes to manage it.\n\nGetting Learnable Programming to work across our backend project would be a massive undertaking, especially if we treated all of the existing code as “dead” code that couldn’t be changed / rethought to better suit the features we want.\n\nOn the flip side, looking at the stories of Ruby and Python give us hope that greatness can come by rebuilding from scratch instead of trying to adding good type inference to Java and simplifying the Java syntax by adding pre-processors!\n\nBy creating something new from scratch, you have the opportunity to focus on niche end-users who were underserved by existing solutions. This is how startups (as well as new PL’s like python and ruby) actually succeed, b/c small niche efforts can rarely integrate back into existing monolithic / bureaucratic systems. Strawman example.. but Uber / Lyft didn’t work with taxicab commissions but instead creating a new system from scratch.",

In my day job I’m a developer evangelist for Mixed Reality at Mozilla, but I’ve had programming languages and usability as a passion of mine for many years. A lot stems from my belief that the best technology is something which empowers people to solve their own problems.  The computer was supposed to be “the bicycle for the mind”, and yet it’s getting less hackable and customizable over time.  There is such enormous potential in providing programmability to people who are experts in something other than programming.\n\nAlso, I think there has to be a better way to program computers than ascii text stored on disk. Surely when we build the Starship Enterprise in 300 years it won’t still have a command line in it. Right? :slightly_smiling_face:",

It was invented by a man far too smart for his own good, and blessed with a prodigious memory, he could hold in his head the precedence and left-to-right or right-to-left priority of all his operators. A more ordinary mind is constantly getting snared in APL's traps, where you don't understand how many operators are doing what in what direction.",

Computers aren't good at dealing with ambiguities (and I'd argue they shouldn't have to deal with ambiguities at all). Because programs stored as text are ambiguous (e.g. \"Which version of Python does this script require?\", \"Where do I find the library 'numpy'? And what version do I need?\"), we invented a whole bunch of bolt-on tools (e.g. dependency management) and rules so that our programs become less ambiguous.\n\nIt's clear that these ambiguities need to be resolved, but we can choose when to do that. I'd argue that it should happen as soon as possible. For example, your editor should know that you write Python 3.7 by default and encode that in the storage representation unless you specify something else. The representation shared between people should be unambiguous.\n\nThink of it like talking to a (human) assistant. If you tell them \"Please call Mary and tell her that Tom wants to meet her at 8PM\", the assistant would probably ask which 'Tom' you meant and would assume that the time was referring to your current time zone. Using the additional information, the assistant could inform Mary (assuming that 'Mary' is unambiguous). If they'd just do the call (without asking for clarification), Mary would have to guess the exact meaning of 'Tom' and the time.\n\nIn programming we're guessing and working around ambiguity issues all the time and I wonder if another storage representation could solve this.",

For example, Aaron Hsu has created co-dfns, an optimizing compiler for APL that generates GPU code, in about 750 lines of code. The compiler itself runs on a GPU. My own GPU compiler is &gt;16,000 lines of object oriented C++, with only a rudimentary optimizer. I would not have thought it possible to write this kind of software in APL, or to run a compiler on a GPU. The compactness of Aaron's code is astonishing. <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13797797>",

My academic background is maths, so I’m not super strong on the compsci theoretical side, but I learnt coding from my dad, and then through doing dev work for charities for some years I stumbled into many similar beliefs to those expressed here. In particular I’m very interested in the ‘coding for non-coders’ endeavour, e.g. FRP, excel-like systems, user empowerment etc. I’ve been working on a new language in this vein over the past year, and am excited to see what you guys think - I’ll share in the feedback channel :slightly_smiling_face:",

    "text": "APL was decades ahead of all the other languages of its day. It was very close to what Mathematica became. It had a REPL terminal environment, and there was a built-in plot function that drew a nice graph (even on golf-ball terminal). Languages which have graphing built into the primitive system are wonderful for getting projects going fast. This is why Excel is so commonly used, and perhaps a very strong reason why Tableau got picked up for such a huge valuation. Drawing a nice graph is constantly needing to be done, and having such facilities already at hand makes for a much easier product acceptance. APL was actually a pain in the ass, and a few weeks after writing a paragraph of code it was like cryptography to read it again.",

    "text": "Hi folks.  I'm here at the invitation of David Broderick, who liked a \"Future of Programming\" video I did a few years ago.  I started coding on the IBM 1130 in the early '70s and my first programming language stuff was doing the code generator for (what became) the \"Sargasso C\" compiler for TOPS-10/-20 in the late '70s.  I did machine learning in the '80s, artificial life and distributed systems in the '90s, and biological approaches to computer security in the '00s.  Since about 2008 I've been on a mission to develop a computer architecture that abandons the assumption of hardware determinism and instead embraces best-effort throughout a reinvented computational stack.  The resulting \"Movable Feast Machine\" looks like a cellular automata on steroids and we are only at the beginnings of developing basic structures and programming paradigms for it.",

We need more standards for interoperability of _basic ideas_, e.g. spatial ideas like points / lines / shapes, colors, time intervals and time series, units/dimensions/coordinate systems, sorted/unsorted/spatial collections, graphs / relationships, metadata, visualization concepts.... A recurring problem is that we have language-specific standards, industry-specific standards, and company-specific standards for all of these things, instead of fully general standards.\n\n2. We need better standard data formats. Probably with layering - we have the layered OSI model of communications, but our data formats are usually factored minimally, sometimes in one level (a monolithic domain-specific data format) and sometimes in two levels (in the lower layer, bytes are interpreted as JSON, then the higher layer understands the dictionaries/lists in some way). If we're being generous we could say there is a third layer that interprets bytes as characters. But it seems like more standard layers than this would be valuable.",

TLang for now is more like an evolving spec than runnable code, currently available here <https://bitbucket.org/sebastien/tlang/src/default/> -- I'm working on publishing the whole design docs in a more accessible format when I land in Wellington. I'm surprised they didn't take you, did you try the skilled worker visa? There's also the Edmund Hilary Fund <https://www.ehf.org/>",

I have a background in control and systems theory and information theory and I've been working on a kind of closed-loop approach to declarative programming. This has involved defining a progress measure for a computation in terms of an information-gain game between the system and the logic/environment, and an adaptive evaluation procedure based on trying to maximize performance in this game. More concretely, it's a probabilistic relational language written in Julia that uses ideas from game tree search to learn to do well at that game. The main strategy for optimizing is finding highly informative inference paths connecting facts to queries, which are essentially dataflows, so I got some ideas about a dataflow-oriented but still general purpose VM/hardware which I'm calling the Route Machine and which I think might synergize quite well with the Movable Feast Machine ideas. Looking forward to discussing more.\nI also enjoyed a quick look at the podcast backlog and am keen on taking in more of the culture. I've been a bit dry since Lambda the Ultimate declined in activity.",

Some errors lead to untypable terms that can be identified statically, without doing any rewriting. Others lead to error terms that occur during rewriting. The interesting part is that the distinction between the two is not baked in the language. It's the type hierarchy that decides. You can actually make a statically signalled error go away by adding a more general type to your hierarchy. Inversely, you can narrow down types as you develop your code in order to get more static checks.",

I’m determined to build life-like robustness into a new computing stack. As a concrete analogy: I like to think of how primitive cellular functions build upon each other to achieve higher level goals. This could be similar to how traditional software functions are composed today. The best part is we get to start from scratch. Removing billions of years of cruft :-) we can build crisp and predictable functions with good reuse. That’s part of the fun and challenge of this work, and we’re definitely still at the beginning. Would love to get to know you all and answer questions!\n\nEdit: I hang out in: <#CL0FBFS8H|robust-computation> and <http://gitter.im/t2tile/> is where most of the real work happens.",

    "text": "Hi all, invited by <@UE6EFEPTQ> after I contacted him about his Onex project I found a few months ago. From my interest in astronomy, found <http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/futurelang.php> and Lojban, then Clean. As a basic/assembler/c++ coder, I discovered functional programming. Then I looked for LISP, quickly found Erlang, then Racket. My latest discoveries are Picat and Elm (and perhaps Pyret). Always had a problem with programming language verbosity, how much \"useless\" lines have to be input before getting actual things done. Java someone ? Anyway, thinking about my own programming language for years now, something more about declarative programming (Picat) but that can be also edited visually. Hence my interest in Onex and TreeSheets (from <@UHDQ62M4P> ). I really like the spreadsheet representation that can already be found in property sheets, close to data base editing. Wanna add data ? Add columns/rows. Wanna change the code ? Add more formulas. And the underlying code is still textual and can be edited using a terminal and/or refactored/analyzed using standard tools. I'd like to avoid the culprit programming languages such like Labview of Windev that needs a proprietary, complex and heavyweight IDE to edit/compile the code. My main aim is ai, db and embedded coding. I like easy prototyping languages like Python, interpreted and/or fast to compile, easy to debug. Also greatly interested/influenced by Bret Victor's work on real-time feedback user interfaces. So, here I am, and thanks for the invitation.",

In my day job, I work on an actively developed, but 18 year old (and very creaky) code base of a few million lines, which has helped give me an interest in automated refactoring and static analysis. I have some vague ideas for making those tools easy to write. I also have a project in progress for an IDE facility to fuzz a function and display input-output pairs that exercise different branches: <https://github.com/hyperpape/quicklook> (that’s just the core fuzzing facility, the IDE integration is a work in progress).",

I didn't really follow it deeply but I worried that the adaptive mechanism seemed quite aggressive -- and thus perhaps liable to be misled by early data on more complex examples.  Is that impossible for some reason?  It made me wish for a comparison to Prolog-with-random-search-order (something like the suggestion in <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45681109/randomizing-priority-in-prolog-predicates> ).  It seems like such a 'Randolog' would do almost as well as adaptive evaluation on the cases you show, but wouldn't get faked out by deceptive computations.",

Is the idea that the adaptive evaluation framework would be applied in an 'ongoing process' framework, with closed-loop interactions through an environment?  Simple Prolog examples subconsciously convey 'finite algorithm' to me, but it would be cool if the adaptive stats are expected to carry over from one program evaluation to the next as input assumptions change.",

    "text": "Hi everyone! I have just posted this question to hackernews and got to the frontpage. One of the comments suggested this channel but I don't really know anyone. (<https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20431879>)\n\nI am 26, have a BSc in computers science. I did not go further to MSc, because I deeply felt my university does not emphasize the right things. Eg. we barely learned about FP and nothing on Dependent Types, but my interest was always to write the cleanest and most expressive code possible.\n\nI tried to look up and search many things in the last years: OOP, Uncle Bobs Clean Code series, classic GoF Design Patterns, DCI Architecture, Prolog and Logic programming, UML, Statecharts, reading on FP &amp; Type Systems, research on Temporal Logic and model validation, TDD, property based testing, using (runtime) assertions to reason, Eiffel and Design By Contract. None of these made me happy, I always felt something is just missing. My intuition said it is closely related to logic, reasoning, and boolean \"tagging\" of values/objects as \"properties\" (how to model odd/even numbers), the support of incremental implementation of code, plus a huge one: some help/reasoning on ordering of computations: aka taming async code which might get complicated really quickly... and of course some neat IDE support for that: neat \"views\" to focus on different but related parts of the implemented code and study their relations with or without other logic statements already coded up.\n\n2 years ago I have found a youtube video on Idris and Dependent Types from Edward Brady and I was fascinated. I've seen the \"properties\" part I was looking for, the holes in code and some awesome self-written definitions, awesome case split. I googled Dependent Types, I have found Agda, Coq and Idris, checked some videos about them, but I was not sure if they are what I am really looking for or is there something more. This lead me to write the Ask HN post I mentioned above, I wanted to make sure I am not missing anything before investing in learning Dependent Types.\n\nAfter reading the comments and connecting some dots I think the main intuitions I had are addressed exactly by Dependent Types, but I am really curious about further/other ideas what are going on, plus to join to a community who might use these tools.\n\nI am wondering about the jobs and the fit of Dependent Types for my personal projects. I am a game developer now (Unity), but before that I used React / React Native, I am really interested in bindings with these technologies, but maybe it is not even necessary. I'd really happy to learn about real world options, how/where to use DT to make some money.",

    "text": "<@UL3CJ7YKC> Hi there, almost the same trajectory in the academic side and have felt this dissatisfaction myself. I totally get your itch to write elegant code and I have explored some of the things you have mentioned there. And your feeling of coming out unsatisfied with those methods is on point, because most of those fields are actively researched. As you intuited, logic is indeed the place I arrived at to finally understand what is going on.\n\nI am out of my depth about the last statement of making market value capture by learning logic (though theoretically possible). But if that's not a priority I can show some ways up the abstraction hierarchy that might unite all of CS and help you probably arrive at at least one good way to express your programs elegantly (Mind you, it would be a big dump of pointers which I haven't myself untangled but shows great promise. So it would be like someone lost sharing his bits of the map he collected on his way).",

I don't know if you have looked at type level computations - they are a limited for of dependent types and have a lot of power.

I think Jim Coplien has a good view of what part of that thing is though, and following his stuff led me to other things (most directly, to Alan Kay and Christopher Alexander (whose work in physical architecture inspired software Design Patterns)).\n\nAnyway, I spent more than a year trying to wrap my head around DCI, like what it is *really* about, and that's opened my eyes on some things -- though I don't think DCI itself fixes anything. That started me on similar journeys to understand that OOP and Design Patterns and many other things have fallen far from what they were originally about, etc. etc. Funny thing is that \"Uncle\" Bob Martin understands this and explains it to some degree, but most software folk that subscribe to him (and his \"clean code\" architecture) wind up excited about new ways to make software more and more needlessly complex and mechanistic.\n\nAnyway, I'd be interested in discussing more of this with you, and hearing your take / journey, if you're interested.\n\nI think most people in this community have some story or journey to tell :)",

    "text": "Hi <@UAVCC2X70>! Thanks for your response! :slightly_smiling_face: I am glad to have a conversation on that! :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nI have seen almost all Uncle Bob episodes and read the GoF book and many other OO &amp; Design Patterns books because I was really curious what was going on with these “patterns” when started to study OO at the university in my country, Hungary.\n\nOO and Uncle Bob and their debate (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtHQGs3zFAM>) led me to DCI and Jim Coplien. The first couple times I did not get DCI, I think despite Jim tries hard he can’t explain the essence of DCI. This guy, Andreas Soderlund does better job I think. ( <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0ebZHUixa0> ). Or maybe his understanding is not proper which would mean neither is mine! :smile:\n\nI really think that the nature of the problems (at least the harder=more important) we want to address through computing is “dynamic” - something which needs runtime information and runtime bindings. Complexity arises for sure when I can’t just “enumerate” all the possible states/relations “static”/“compile” time and I need to postpone some computation until multiple pieces of information are gathered together. Because of that I felt I’m just done with Class-based OO and I’ll rather focus on “compositions” (over inheritance) and runtime behaviour. At this point I thought something might still be “over there” in OO I’m not aware of, and when I first met DCI I deeply thought/“felt” this will be the thing!\n\nWhat I have in my mind for a long time is that the same object can play multiple “roles” in multiple “contexts”. (The funny thing is that this comes from Prolog which I studied for a half year at the uni and I was amazed how flexible it is with the “relations” between “objects”/“facts?“.)\n\nFurthermore these roles and contexts often need runtime information to put them together (here is the “dynamic”) but I just could not find out how to express that, I was looking for something “deep” and in retrospectively more powerful (than DCI). I really thought if that is deep that must be hard and I did not notice the elephant in the room.\n\nAt the same time I started to look into FP and think about the corresponding FP variant of any OO piece of code. Today I am 99.9% sure there is no feature of OO which would be superior to FP, if you are interested I might create a post on that. But basically DCI itself seems to me just a really really simple pattern: creating and (dynamically) populating data structures which do have references on other data structures which do belong together. Bam. I really think there is nothing more than that.\n\nI found Andreas’ video 2 weeks ago so I am really happy to discuss this topic, in fact I have already created a tweet with a related question to Jim and Andreas.\nIt addresses the problem of asynchronicity and parallel/concurrent computing which is the root of all evil in my code even if there is no more than 100 lines. It just blows up if I face these issues and I immediately corner myself so there is no way to refactor out myself from that horror. So these days I am focusing on these and I was wondering what DCI says about that.\n\nLook here: <https://twitter.com/ZoliPeto/status/1151101824595910657>\n\nAnd this was literally my last attempt with OO, since that I had some deep thinking on the topic and I am sure neither OO nor DCI have real solution for taming the complexity in software, its in FP with Types.\n\nI do get and agree with many of your points: DCI as “something promising”, Uncle Bob’s half-baked solutions, OO &amp; Design Patterns as the rigid opposite of the wannabe flexible themselves.",

There’s lots of cool work going on at the moment, especially in the realm of modal type theory, and I’m hoping some of it starts coming together in cool, practical ways!\n\nMy advice is to keep plugging away learning, and talk about it online like you’re doing. You might be surprised who you bump into! But it will probably be more of a case of ‘putting yourself in a position to be lucky’, and networking, than finding a job advertised explicitly.",

It's taken reflection over years, but it boils down to principle typing being a sweet spot where you can ask what is *the* type of an expression.  Knowing additional properties is nice, but there's finesse: what additional type information is relevant for a given task.  For example, within a library you really want to know that data-structure invariants are maintained, but as the user of the library you're happy to ignore those details.",

I wonder how others see FBP as a general purpose way of coding  while dealing with it's disadvantages like performance issues.",

    "text": "Hi <@UAVCC2X70>\n\nThis used to be called cooperative multitasking.  It was discredited in Windows 3.1, and then never(?) tried in an application setting (instead of in an O/S setting).\n\nI believe that we need to get rid of the call-stack.  Esp. in a world where “everything is smart” and cpus are cheap.  The only (reasonable) way in which things can talk to each other is over a wire, not using a call-stack (for the comms/IPC part).\n\nIn that kind of world, all software components must be designed to be concurrent.  [Hence, my interest in FBP.  I used to conflate “concurrency” with “parallelism” until I saw Rob Pike’s talk “Concurrency is not Parallelism (It’s Better)“.  (If you search for the talk, note that it has been renamed to drop the parenthsized bit)].\n\nIt is nearly trivial to implement cooperative multitasking using closures. A list of closures is randomly walked by a single routine - the Dispatcher.  The Dispatcher calls a closure.  Then, when the closure returns, the Dispatcher calls another closure.  The closures cannot (must not) directly call each other, they can communicate only by leaving events (short messages) in queues.  In this way, the call-stack only becomes 1 level deep.\n\nCooperative multitasking works in an application setting because, a bug - anywhere in the app - is - just a bug.  We don’t need MMUs to protect one subroutine from another inside an app.\n\nThis matches the FBP model and the thing I’m working on (incl. a set of rules to “structure” message passing).\n\nIf early OS developers didn’t have a disdain for Lisp and friends, they might have used closures instead of manually building closures in C and assembler (aka multiple stacks).",

One is obvious - an OS is under the control of the companies that make it. A third party cannot simply add a feature to Windows that allows two concurrent users with their own screens, mouse and keyboard, let alone a system where two users share the same screens; MS wouldn't want to redesign the OS to allow things like that because it might reduce their revenue (two users should buy two licenses!)\n\nMore subtly, I'm not a businessman, I'm a developer, and I have no interest in the business side of launching a startup. I have ideas that no businessperson could possibly have (extensibility and interoperability being technical problems), but without a business model and a business guy that can dream up a path to profitability and find investors, I can't implement my ideas. (UBI FTW?)\n\nMore broadly, while the business side is always a challenge, for a great many \"future of coding\" problems, it seems to me that the current world order is structurally against solving them (the incentives are missing, and we need those incentives to buy food). Which is not to say that the problems won't get solved, just that it will be a very slow, painful, annoying process that we will have to fight hard to be involved with.",

In retrospect this is incredible.\"\n\nGood luck in the past doesn't imply continued good luck. I am reminded of the anthropic principle: if we were dead, we wouldn't notice. Life may not exist in 99.99% of the universe, and where it arises it may die out in 99% of all cases. Whatever life is left over notices that it is still alive, but this is actually not a reason for optimism. (See also: The Great Filter)\n\nGlobal warming is totally solvable and I like to talk to people about how to solve it... but I'm concerned because we're not on the right path yet.",

    "text": "I'd like a tool that can detect relationships in a large, poorly-written code base, and thus opportunities to refactor, e.g.\n\n- In code bases with lots of long argument lists, detect when many different functions take the same set of three or more parameters, e.g. you might detect that three methods with long argument lists all take (Interface1 foo, Interface2 bar, int baz). This can be enhanced by including fieldsets (sets of fields in a class) in the same analysis if they are not already initialized by a constructor in the analysis.\n- Build a graph of relationships among classes to detect statically circular dependencies, and then treat those cycles as if they were one big class for the next step. The next step is to analyze the fields within the classes looking for fields that are somehow clustered, e.g. fields X Y Z are only used by methods F G H, while fields A B C are only used by methods P Q R S T. Enhancement: detect when an interface has only a single implementation and then treat the interface as the same thing as the class during the analysis.",

I'm not sure how I ended up here, maybe because of the Bret Victor fan club thing, maybe because I sit below the TypeScript team room and Mr. Hejlsberg's influence seeped through the ceiling, or maybe because of the actually really good podcasts by Steve — anyway, nice to be here :stuck_out_tongue:\n\nIn my work I maintain the HTML/CSS Language Servers in VS Code, and for fun I'm building the Vue Language Server (<https://vuejs.github.io/vetur/>). I feel Language Server Protocol is one of the interesting/new area of focuses in the language design/tooling space, and I'm exploring with programming tools that complement programming languages &amp; enable new paradigms of programming. I see many interesting conversations and links floating around, and I look forward to joining the discussions!\n\nI'm based in Seattle but would travel to London/Tokyo/NYC soon. To borrow the tweet from ep35, if you are inspired by the Bret Victor talk, or the topics of LSP &amp; programming editors/tools, I'd love to meet you over coffee. Coffee is on me :wink:",

People develop strong preferences for specific editors, and all younger programmers are used to partial completion suggestions and coloration.",

I am a Smalltalk fan and love reading about the history of the language and have volunteered for the eruopean smalltalk user group last year. My goal is to contribute to Pharo.

    "text": "Hi all, I am engineer in industry for a while, but lately I am getting more involved in research as well and trying to find the right blend for myself. My main communities these days are Mozilla, LLVM, and Matrix. I recently moved from Chicago to London.\n\nI believe mainstream computing has failed to deliver on many of the ways it could be empowering everyone in society (not just specialist programmers) and enabling communities to create and share specialised solutions to long-tail problems that improve their daily lives. I am exploring various approaches to restore some of the magic that's been lost. More thoughts on my blog: <https://convolv.es/blog/now.html>",

I’m a developer and product designer, currently at Mailchimp, and have had an intense fascination with interfaces and the democratization of computing for as long as I can remember.\n\nI fully believe that to expand access to the computer’s nature as an interactive medium, we have to provide tools beyond code that enable everyone to take part, just as Photoshop did for image editing or the typewriter did for text, and I’ve been working on a project with just that in mind. However, I’ve been in a silo on this and I’m just beginning to discover all of the incredible research and resources out there around visual programming and conveying interaction beyond code.\n\nI can’t wait to hear more about the ideas for what’s next that y’all are working on. :pray:",

    "text": "Aloha everyone. I'm Breck, a researcher at the UH Cancer Center Honolulu. My main communities these days are HN, Lobsters, /r/programminglanguages/, and SUS. I work on Tree Notation and am creating the Tree Notation Lab here. Our theory is there is a natural notation sitting between binary notation and higher level languages that has been overlooked and it could be a silver bullet. We call it Tree Notation and it's very promising (though we might have some details wrong---always looking for help). To be thorough, we build the largest database of programming and computer languages in the world with over 10K languages and over 1K columns (in the process of open sourcing it!). The first key applications we are working on is for a new data science language and studio for cancer/bioinformatics researchers, and a new grammar for electronic medical records. We are also helping over 30 companies now experiment with new languages in domains from tax returns to logic languages to visual ides and new languages for deep learning. DC referred me to this community and it looks very cool! I have never gotten into the Slack habit, so I apologize for noob mistakes.",

    "text": "Hi <@UEQ6M68H0>. There are no errors at the Tree Notation level, just as there is no such thing as an error in binary notation. However, there are errors at the \"Tree Language\" level. If you try some of the sample languages in the designer app (you might need a stiff drink--the app is still early stages), you can make an error and see how because Tree Languages are so much easier to parse since the AST == Source Code and there's no visible syntax characters, we can create a whole new generation of more intelligent editing experiences. Right now, depending on the type of error, we are able to suggest autocorrections immediately. I 100% agree with you in the importance of reliability. I expect we see a reduction in software defects of 10x+ in Tree Projects vs current projects across the industry in a few years. Once you have put a software project in the minimal Tree form, it's done and timeless. The parts of our software stack that have the fewest bugs are all in Tree Languages now.",

All I need is access to the document, and can easily spit out hightlight scopes for any position programmatically if I can run my own parser code.

I've worked alongside lots of bioinformaticians, researchers, and clinicians analyzing data and writing code ; been coauthor on 10 or so peer reviewed papers now (a few still in the review process) whereas before I couldn't define \"peer review\" ; I've been on the reviewer side of the table; have gone to the academic conferences and talks; gotten to know lots of academics and got some great mentors. So I think I at least now \"know how to research properly\" (thought I reserve my right to do it in a slightly different way :wink: ) which has been helpful. I also just doubled down heavily on getting better at building huge curated datasets, because data trumps brains :slightly_smiling_face:.",

    "text": "Well Breck, how about taking one or more of the examples from my github repository of the tiny 500 -1000 word programs, and show how they might be represented in your tree notation. In the case of the clock, the Beads notation form is already within spitting distance of the minimum possible length program, and i don't believe that merely putting things into AST form makes the program more understandable. The comments are gone in tree form as your examples in your paper show, so isn't this more like LISP without parentheses? I agree that editing in the AST has some advantages in terms of prediction, but creation of new content is more mysterious to me. This is why some people are heading towards fill-in-the-blanks type of approaches, so you have support for entering the fields you need, and the keywords are put in the right place. I think if you took a larger program like chess it might obscure the meaning of the code to put it into a deeply nested tree. Deep nesting is the enemy of comprehension, as LISP proved 50 years ago.",

If i recall correctly Jonathan Edwards' subtext prototypes also used that concept, and then there are various shipping products that use the fill-in-the-blanks paradigm to the extent they can. In a way, intellitype suggestions are a kind of fill in the blanks.  Everyone knows that when you take a test, the easiest kind of test is true/false, followed by multiple choice, then fill in the blanks, then essay is the hardest. Since programming is mostly an essay test, it is the hardest kind of work, and moving it to fill in the blanks is taking it up one level of simplicity. That is unarguable. I haven't seen even a fake screen of an interface that moves i up to the highest two levels.

I'm not worried about overstaying the conclusions. I still am always on the hunt for flaws, but after over 2 years and feedback from over 1k people without anyone providing a single proof by contradiction, and over 1k weekly users now, I'm slightly more confident in the grandiose claims? I dunno. Regardless, I'm more of an empiricist than a theorist, and think the best arguments in favor of Tree Notation will be killer apps. Which require killer tools. Which requires lots more work. :cry:",

    "text": "From the FAQ: \"Tree Notation is the first notation where a visual design tool can generate code as good as someone can write by hand. Traditional languages have a critical flaw–there are infinite ways to represent any given structure. In Tree Notation there is only 1 way to represent 1 structure. This simplification is one of a few core reasons why Tree Notation is helping solve the Visual Programming problem.\"\nI don't get this. Sure, there are many ways to encode the same program in PLs (e.g. single-line vs. multi-line arrays), but that's a feature and not a flaw. It allows programmers to insert whitespace such that the program becomes as readable as possible. Tree Notation seems disallow this. Sure, this means that it's easier for a VPL to generate human-grade code, but only because the human-grade code in Tree Notation is less readable than in current PLs. That's not an improvement for me.",

I was thinking about this exactly, but in my head this thought developed into something different. I got this idea of storage for DAG (just like git), with generic browser that allows to edit and observe (just like text editors). This browser gonna look like Excel, but for trees (DAGs).\n\nMaybe this is natural, simple foundation that is one step above binary?",

My current controversial opinions/hypotheses are that in most companies design and product really do most of the \"programming\" (but little of the coding), developers have developed internal models of the subsets of Turing machines that behave well but we haven't made those explicit, and category theory may provide a useful way to model programs and guarantee properties under composition (but currently feels primarily descriptive).",

    "text": "Hi everybody, I just found this community today through the Whole Code Catalog that was getting shared on Twitter, adding the podcast to my list as well. I’m an engineer working on design and prototyping of voice user interfaces at Adobe, primarily on Adobe Xd and previously at my startup Sayspring that focused on Alexa and Google Home.\n\nTend to stick to HN and Twitter (@scottwernerd), and ran into <@UCUSW7WVD> online a while back through Ribbonfarm and his blog. Actually got into an argument the other day around code style that ended with me sending someone a link to one of your old blog posts :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nAnyway, current side project is working on an idea around reading and exploring code I got from the end of The Timeless Way of Building. I don’t have the book with me, but the drawings on the right side on page 488 are the key idea - being able to visualize how code evolves over time at different levels (project, file, class, function, etc). I’m still in the early stages, so don’t really know if anything interesting is going to fall out, but happy to chat more if that sounds interesting to anyone.",

    "text": "Thanks, yeah I’m hoping to have something to interact with and share before the end of the month, . But if you’ve ever used the fugitive.vim’s `Glog` command to move forward and back through a file’s history, I think its possible to break that apart and have interactive visualizations where you can move forward and back at the project/file level, the class level, the function level and maybe even find ways to drop into an interactive session for any of those pieces. One idea I have is using code coverage tools to get a list of tests that touch a specific function, and then being able to start a debugger session at a particular spot at a particular point in time in the project’s history with the test taking care of all the setup for you.\n\nEssentially all the information you need is there in the git history of the project, and I think if you combine it with a few different tools and focus your interface/UX to the use case of reading/understanding code, there’s something there :slightly_smiling_face:",

We cater to the surface level understanding of the game designers who barely code, to the gameplay developers who care about games than the complexity of a rendering engine, to the game engine developers who have to provide understanding of all the cases but don't have bandwidth to dedicate to being a gameplay developer.\n\nIn Godot Engine, we have several coding interfaces. C++ core, C++ as a shared library GDNative, GDScript which is a custom python-like game script,  and Visual Script which is a Node and Wire graphical editor. <https://godotengine.org/>\n\nI and a Google summer of code student have been improving Visual Script from it's current unusable state. <https://godotengine.org/article/gsoc-2019-progress-report-3#visual-scripting> The work has been done, but it's not fully merged yet. Godot Engine is not just capable of games, imagine using a single executable editor / game for other things!",

Saw the catalogue post on HN and found it super interesting :slightly_smiling_face: I'm one of the cofounders of <https://withkoji.com> , a web-based IDE + hosting platform trying to make it easier for non-devs and junior devs to create games and web apps (JS or JS-flavored things) by remixing existing apps and then using a combination of code and no-code interfaces to create something new. We're fresh out of beta, and already have a ton of different people from all around the world and all walks of life creating all kinds of weird things -- the goal is to do to app development what YouTube did to video publishing. Some more info here: <https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/23/gometa-raises-6-million-and-launches-koji-web-app-development-platform/> and here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgpFGMH6VR4> (long technical video). Anyway, excited to have found this community and look forward to participating more!",

Just handling recertification for free using the certs that you renew every 30 days saves people a lot of money (several hundred dollars for code signing certs from most companies, because there is a monopoly now with all the acquisitions of certificate issuing authorities). Trying to develop inside a browser with the inability to write the local hard drive makes software development almost impossible, so their connection to a server spun up from a pool is very clever.  I made a lot of iphone apps, and waiting 2 weeks for approval, not to mention the $99/year is an impediment of sorts.",

Been into code generation since I was a kid since I’m too lazy to write code the “normal” way :joy:\nCurrently working on a “code editor” (I like to call it a software editor or a list editor, like treenotation designer), using kotlin and tornadofx mostly - You starts from the datatypes, workflow connections (visual connect the dots) and ends up with a generated graphql w axon-kafka or molecular.js backend and a flutter mobile app (that’s kinda the MVP goal) but I want it to be language-independent. Basically, I want it to be to IDE’s what Lisp is to Java  My current minigoal  is to use it to write the editor itself, that’s gonna be a PITA in itself but I think I might have it in a month or so. Can’t wait to share it with y’all and learn a thing or two here :slightly_smiling_face:",

Our tech is like Flash, without code, responsive, and state machine based. Anyways we're currently looking to partner up with content creators.

We do have some pre-canned animations, and we wouldn't be too far off from letting you build your own animations up from scratch.\n\nAs of right now our interactivity is mostly focused on showing/hiding things, and screen navigation. We allow for branching or linear (scrolling up/down or swiping left/right) screen navigation.\n\nWe may *not* be well suited if you often create characters and do a lot of animation in Flash. Buttttt you have inspired me. Would love to hear more about why your team still uses Flash. Honestly, I kinda miss the Flash days. There's still a level of interactivity we can't pull off right now with our current web tech.",

I see your tool as making content more akin to digital articles rather than the games and animations Flash was known for.

Our 3 word vision is \"apps for everyone\". It's a big vision but that's where we want to go.\n\nWe're also unsure about drawing a parallel with Flash honestly. I guess I've been thinking lately that although Flash had a bad rep at the end, IMO it definitely had more of that apps for everyone mantra than where we're at today on the web. It ushered in a massive wave of amateur and professional coders making really rich applications.",

    "text": "A lot of the Flash bad reputation was nasty propaganda from Adobe hating companies, which included almost everyone. Adobe makes great stuff, but so many other companies feared it. Microsoft and Apple both did battle with Adobe's creativity tools, and often came up on the losing end. MS spent untold hundreds of millions building clones of Flash/Shockwave (their Silverlight), and tried to build publishing tools, etc., and Apple also had a fantasy that their Pages would somehow hold up against InDesign. MS and Apple teamed up to make TrueType to counter Adobe's Type 1 font format which they didn't want to pay for. Lots of rivalries between these companies, and lots of FUD (fear uncertainty and doubt) press releases sponsored by the negative-evangelical arms of those firms. Not many people  acknowledge the existence of those kinds of PR staffers, but they do exist.  I am personally sick of people pretending that everyone in the valley is playing sports like a proper english gentleman. There are tons of dirty tricks, and the bigger the company the dirtier they get IMHO. Who can forget Intel paying companies huge bonuses if they ship only 100% intel parts. that is so purely anticompetitive, they should have put intel CEO in jail.",

The balloon color represents syntactic structure and the text color is supposed to be type, but I haven’t gotten there yet. At any time you’re focused on one node in the structure, which conditions which editing commands are available.

Fortunately, I’ve fallen in love with coding and the amount of creativity it takes to solve a problem. Currently I am working through freecodecamp and just started playing with python. Also, MIT open source is absolutely incredible. So thankful for the amount of knowledge they are willing to share.\nSteve’s podcast is how I found this group. Hoping I will have some projects to share soon.",

You are drawing the microscopic local variables, yet in a program like Snake or TicTacToe (see <https://github.com/magicmouse/beads-examples>\n), one has the core model stored in some data structure which holds the source of truth, which for TicTacToe might be whose turn it is, what is in the 9 cells of the grid, etc., then you have the layout of the screen, which has its own data structures, and then you have user input events, which are not data but a stream of inputs driving the finite state machine of the game. There is negligible computation in this example, and if you diagram the functions you would make it less understandable. I like visual tools, but diagramming local variables and formal parameter inputs is too low level IMHO. Lots of things one could draw nicely, but the low level computation is perhaps the least interesting thing to show.",

I suppose like many here, I was fascinated by Bret Victor's famous presentation, and I've been following another series of interesting attempts at <https://alarmingdevelopment.org/>.

Aquameta reimplements the layers of a traditional web stack as relational data, so that rows instead of files are the atomic unit.  As an industry, we are really good at building user interfaces to data, and if the whole stack is data, UI that manipulates it very easy to develop.  Explorinng concepts around version control of relational data, datafication of EBNF grammars for data-driven code manipulation from a UI, semantic decoration of the database schema to couple UI components with columns for auto-crud generation that can be progressively enhanced, an on-screen in-app widget editor so that you can edit a UI from within the UI, etc.  Demo videos:  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOpj8lvNJtg&amp;t=4s> and <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8SYrTmUXgU>",

I would be hard pressed to explain to another person what aquameta is good for. In my Beads language i go through making a clock, then a snake game, a calculator, and work my way up to chess, and then i move to client/server apps. That progression of increasing complexity and capability leads people through the features. Maybe show a simple EBNF grammar for some practical application, then show how that works, and then show one kind of widget might be used. Maybe pick temperature in cities or some really easy to understand data set, maybe show a thermometer being animated based on the temperature in the city as an example of a widget synchronized to the data. You have to imagine we just left Excel. That is my recommendation. I'm not trying to bust your chops but give you some honest feedback about how far from clear these presentations are. It is far better to have many short examples than one long one. Because most people absorb in smaller chunks. Computer people have an inbuilt ability to absorb huge amounts of information where parts are fuzzy; that is the darwinian selection criteria for the membership in the profession, but certainly in the future of computing we are aiming to include a much wider audience.",

I can only assume what’s going on in the IDE demo video and not have actual conclusion. Why is bundle management done in multiple seperate windows?   Why are widgets and endpoint resources in the same list? Too many questions and I don’t feel like I could navigate it out of the box. I completely agree with Edward here, you should make a simple practical application “walk through” or give it to someone new so they can try and create an app with it, that would show you where the issues are - and it’s better to do stuff like that now, improving UX will help you with defining your actual feature set instead of doing a ton of work and then trying to redefine UX according to what you’ve already done, since by the time you get there you’ll be used to it and “blind” to the UX issues.",

All programming happens under the hood as some form of data manipulation.  This is just the first barely functional UI, still in the \"holy cow it works\" stages.",

The foreign wrappers seem great and I understand you get out of the box querying of the data, but tbh seems more like you should build one of your own :thinking_face:\n\nI’d say the UX is pretty important, even for demos. Because that means the  way you understand a system, interact with it and get to/create information you want. And it’s kind of a lengthy process to understand yours - I’d say 1st it’s because there’s too much distributed information - maybe make a concise readme (like make a simple walk through for a practical app and something like that filesystem via postrgresql post (it is a great sample of how datafication works) and add some architectural diagrams and overviews of how things work in general)\n\n2nd is the editor - you’re exposing\nthe internal representation of data outwards, and that turns out confusing, because there’s the mental representation of application and there’s the internal engine representation. That means it’s confusing to think about one and see the other, expands your mental scope and makes it a bigger load to think about. I understand that it’s just a development UI which you use for debugging, but approaching from an end-user perspective you’ll probably find out more about how the API’s should look like than by purely developing.",

But now with a supercomputer in a billion pockets, we are really only limited by our ability to program. There is however a conspiracy among the tech giants to keep things super complex and under their control, so that no upstart company can crack their monopolies. Complexity is the main weapon used to dominate, and i think you will find many revolutionaries lurking in this slack group, dedicated to toppling the status quo.

This is bizarre because the tools for making software is ... other software!\n\nMy solution is ... something like this (I can explain more later if it piques your interest):\n\n<https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/ba/DrawingHands.jpg>",

    "text": "software is malleable like sand is malleable. Software has a very tiny cell size, like sand, and as such is very tedious to construct anything. It is not really a flexible material, it is merely a microscopic rigid material, and has to be used in great abundance to achieve good things. The fact that we are not in an era of interchangeable parts means that people have to build their castles over and over custom made, instead of using pre-fab small pieces like lego. Lego is arguably the greatest toy ever invented, founded on the 8 bump brick which snaps together in many ways, but always perfectly. We need better data interchange between pieces and then it will be a much more flexible medium. It's not locked down really; none of the pieces snap together that well.",

    "text": "Hi all! I've been working on a web development platform called Boomla for 14 years, I'm sort of coming out of the bush these days. <https://boomla.com/> I also call it a Website OS as it is a platform where websites are first-class citizens.\nIt is a server-side platform, with its own object-oriented filesystem, functional execution model, package management solution, etc. It can currently be programmed in JavaScript on the server, but it will support multiple languages in the future.\nIt also provides a drag&amp;drop user-interface for end-users to let them build websites. But that's optional, you could build a different frontend for it.\nIt has a web based IDE and lots of documentation. I made the decision early to focus on the platform and not write any new programming language. :smile:\nIt was designed to be low on maintenance. The platform is fast and rock solid stable. Developers tend to agree that the most interesting part of the system is the object oriented filesystem with lots of interesting properties.\nI'm glad for the existence of the group, looking forward to interesting conversations!",

As we are getting ready to launch what we (<https://bitspark.de/>) have been working on, I want to introduce our company Bitspark. We started working on a VPL long before we knew that this community existed and where navie enough to not even search for prior art - doh’. We started from an observation we made as everyday programmers. There so much repetition, and you need to be highly trained to be a software engineer. We asked our selves what the world _after Programming_ would look like. That was in early 2018. Since then, we created a VPL runtime (<https://bitspark.de/slang/>) in Golang, making heavy use of Green Threads (each node in the tree is a green thread all connected via channels). That gave us quite the performance out of the box (<https://bitspark.de/blog/benchmarking-slang>). We have had our ups and downs and doubts and in the process, went through three different (editor) UIs. And then, in early 2019, we decided we need to build a platform around the runtime and the UI to make it easier to access and run/manage.\n\nAnd that is what we (soft) launch in early November.\nWhy am I telling you this? We are looking for like-minded people willing to take the platform for a test drive and provide valuable feedback or provide feedback in any form or shape. (<https://bitspark.de/#private-beta>)",

        "text": "Git is the source code version control system that is rapidly becoming the standard for open source projects. It has a powerful distributed model which allows advanced users to do tricky things with branches, and rewriting history. What a pity that it&rsquo;s so hard to learn, has such an unpleasant command line interface, and treats its users with such utter contempt.\n1. Complex information model\nThe information model is complicated &ndash; and you need to know all of it. As a point of reference, consider Subversion: you have files, a working directory, a repository, versions, branches, and tags. That&rsquo;s pretty much everything you need to know. In fact, branches are tags, and files you already know about, so you really need to learn three new things. Versions are linear, with the odd merge. Now Git: you have files, a working tree, an index, a local repository, a remote repository, remotes (pointers to remote repositories), commits, treeishes (pointers to commits), branches, a stash&hellip; and you need to know all of it.\n2. Crazy command line syntax\nThe command line syntax is completely arbitrary and inconsistent. Some &ldquo;shortcuts&rdquo; are graced with top level commands: &ldquo;git pull&rdquo; is exactly equivalent to &ldquo;git fetch&rdquo; followed by &ldquo;git merge&rdquo;. But the shortcut for &ldquo;git branch&rdquo; combined with &ldquo;git checkout&rdquo;? &ldquo;git checkout -b&rdquo;. Specifying filenames completely changes the semantics of some commands (&ldquo;git commit&rdquo; ignores local, unstaged changes in foo.txt; &ldquo;git commit foo.txt&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t). The various options of &ldquo;git reset&rdquo; do completely different things.\nThe most spectacular example of this is the command &ldquo;git am&rdquo;, which as far as I can tell, is something Linus hacked up and forced into the main codebase to solve a problem he was having one night. It combines email reading with patch applying, and thus uses a different patch syntax (specifically, one with email headers at the top).\n3. Crappy documentation\nThe man pages are one almighty &ldquo;fuck you&rdquo;. They describe the commands from the perspective of a computer scientist, not a user. Case in point:\ngit-push &ndash; Update remote refs along with associated objects\nHere&rsquo;s a description for humans: git-push &ndash; Upload changes from your local repository into a remote repository\nUpdate, another example: (thanks cgd)\ngit-rebase &ndash; Forward-port local commits to the updated upstream head\nTranslation: git-rebase &ndash; Sequentially regenerate a series of commits so they can be applied directly to the head node\n4. Information model sprawl\nRemember the complicated information model in step 1? It keeps growing, like a cancer. Keep using Git, and more concepts will occasionally drop out of the sky: refs, tags, the reflog, fast-forward commits, detached head state (!), remote branches, tracking, namespaces\n5. Leaky abstraction\nGit doesn&rsquo;t so much have a leaky abstraction as&nbsp;no abstraction. There is essentially no distinction between implementation detail and user interface. It&rsquo;s understandable that an advanced user might need to know a little about how features are implemented, to grasp subtleties about various commands. But even beginners are quickly confronted with hideous internal details. In theory, there is the &ldquo;plumbing&rdquo; and &ldquo;the porcelain&rdquo; &ndash; but you&rsquo;d better be a plumber to know how to work the porcelain.\n\nA common response I get to complaints about Git&rsquo;s command line complexity is that &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t need to use all those commands, you can use it like Subversion if that&rsquo;s what you really want&rdquo;. Rubbish. That&rsquo;s like telling an old granny that the freeway isn&rsquo;t scary, she can drive at 20kph in the left lane if she wants. Git doesn&rsquo;t provide any useful subsets &ndash; every command soon requires another; even simple actions often require complex actions to undo or refine.\n\nHere was the (well-intentioned!) advice from a GitHub maintainer of a project I&rsquo;m working on (with apologies!):\n\nFind the merge base between your branch and master: &lsquo;git merge-base master yourbranch&rsquo;\nAssuming you&rsquo;ve already committed your changes, rebased your commit onto the merge base, then create a new branch:\ngit rebase &ndash;onto  HEAD~1 HEAD\ngit checkout -b my-new-branch\nCheckout your ruggedisation branch, and remove the commit you just rebased: &lsquo;git reset &ndash;hard HEAD~1&rsquo;\nMerge your new branch back into ruggedisation: &lsquo;git merge my-new-branch&rsquo;\nCheckout master (&lsquo;git checkout master&rsquo;), merge your new branch in (&lsquo;git merge my-new-branch&rsquo;), and check it works when merged, then remove the merge (&lsquo;git reset &ndash;hard HEAD~1&rsquo;).\nPush your new branch (&lsquo;git push origin my-new-branch&rsquo;) and log a pull request.\nTranslation: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy, Granny. Just rev to 6000, dump the clutch, and use wheel spin to get round the first corner. Up to third, then trail brake onto the freeway, late apexing but watch the marbles on the inside. Hard up to fifth, then handbrake turn to make the exit.&rdquo;\n\n6. Power for the maintainer, at the expense of the contributor\n\nMost of the power of Git is aimed squarely at maintainers of codebases: people who have to merge contributions from a wide number of different sources, or who have to ensure a number of parallel development efforts result in a single, coherent, stable release. This is good. But the majority of Git users are not in this situation: they simply write code, often on a single branch for months at a time. Git is a 4 handle, dual boiler espresso machine &ndash; when all they need is instant.\nInterestingly, I don&rsquo;t think this trade-off is inherent in Git&rsquo;s &nbsp;design. It&rsquo;s simply the result of ignoring the needs of normal users, and confusing architecture with interface. &ldquo;Git is good&rdquo; is true if speaking of architecture &ndash; but false of user interface. Someone could quite conceivably write an improved interface (easygit is a start) that hides unhelpful complexity such as the index and the local repository.\n7. Unsafe version control\nThe fundamental promise of any version control system is this: &ldquo;Once you put your precious source code in here, it&rsquo;s safe. You can make any changes you like, and you can always get it back&rdquo;. Git breaks this promise. Several ways a committer can irrevocably destroy the contents of a repository:\ngit add . / &hellip; / git push -f origin master\ngit push origin +master\ngit rebase -i  / git push\n8. Burden of VCS maintainance pushed to contributors\nIn the traditional open source project, only one person had to deal with the complexities of branches and merges: the maintainer. Everyone else only had to update, commit, update, commit, update, commit&hellip; Git dumps the burden of &nbsp;understanding complex version control on everyone &ndash; while making the maintainer&rsquo;s job easier. Why would you do this to new contributors &ndash; those with nothing invested in the project, and every incentive to throw their hands up and leave?\n9. Git history is a bunch of lies\nThe primary output of development work should be source code. Is a well-maintained history really such an important by-product? Most of the arguments for rebase, in particular, rely on aesthetic judgments about &ldquo;messy merges&rdquo; in the history, or &ldquo;unreadable logs&rdquo;. So rebase encourages you to lie in order to provide other developers with a &ldquo;clean&rdquo;, &ldquo;uncluttered&rdquo; history. Surely the correct solution is a better log output that can filter out these unwanted merges.\n10. Simple tasks need so many commands\nThe point of working on an open source project is to make some changes, then share them with the world. In Subversion, this looks like:\n\nMake some changes\nsvn commit\n…",

You may order a hard-cover version with color illustrations at Blurb. Or you may watch me teaching this material to a live audience.\nPreface\nFor some time now I&rsquo;ve been floating the idea of writing a book about category theory that would be targeted at programmers. Mind you, not computer scientists but programmers &mdash; engineers rather than scientists. I know this sounds crazy and I am properly scared. I can&rsquo;t deny that there is a huge gap between science and engineering because I have worked on both sides of the divide. But I&rsquo;ve always felt a very strong compulsion to explain things. I have tremendous admiration for Richard Feynman who was the master of simple explanations. I know I&rsquo;m no Feynman, but I will try my best. I&rsquo;m starting by publishing this preface &mdash; which is supposed to motivate the reader to learn category theory &mdash; in hopes of starting a discussion and soliciting feedback.\nI will attempt, in the space of a few paragraphs, to convince you that this book is written for you, and whatever objections you might have to learning one of the most abstract branches of mathematics in your &ldquo;copious spare&nbsp;time&rdquo; are totally unfounded.\nMy optimism is based on several observations. First, category theory is a treasure trove&nbsp;of extremely useful programming ideas. Haskell programmers have been tapping this resource&nbsp;for a long time, and the ideas are slowly percolating into other languages, but this process is too slow. We need to speed it up.\nSecond, there are many different kinds of math, and they appeal to different audiences. You might be allergic to calculus or algebra, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean you won&rsquo;t enjoy category theory. I would go as far as to&nbsp;argue&nbsp;that category theory is the kind of math that is particularly well suited for the minds of programmers. That&rsquo;s because category theory &mdash; rather than dealing with particulars &mdash; deals with structure. It deals with the kind of structure that makes programs composable.\nComposition is at the very root of category theory &mdash; it&rsquo;s part of the definition of the category itself. And I will argue strongly that composition is the essence of programming. We&rsquo;ve been composing things forever, long before some great engineer came up with the idea of a subroutine. Some time ago the principles of structured programming revolutionized programming&nbsp;because they made blocks of code composable. Then came object oriented programming, which is all about composing objects. Functional programming is not only about composing functions and algebraic data structures &mdash; it makes concurrency composable &mdash; something that&rsquo;s virtually impossible with other programming paradigms.\nThird, I have a secret weapon, a butcher&rsquo;s knife, with which I will butcher math to make it more palatable to programmers. When you&rsquo;re a professional mathematician, you have to be very careful to get all your assumptions straight, qualify every statement properly, and construct all your proofs rigorously. This makes mathematical papers and books extremely hard to read for an outsider. I&rsquo;m a physicist by training, and in physics we made amazing advances using informal reasoning. Mathematicians laughed at the Dirac delta function, which was made up on the spot by the great physicist P. A. M. Dirac to solve some differential equations. They stopped laughing when they discovered a completely new branch of calculus called distribution theory that formalized Dirac&rsquo;s insights.\nOf course when using hand-waving arguments you run the risk of saying something blatantly wrong, so I will try to make sure that there is solid mathematical theory behind informal arguments in this book. I do have a worn-out copy of Saunders Mac Lane&rsquo;s Category Theory for the Working Mathematician on my nightstand.\nSince this is category theory for programmers I will illustrate all major concepts using computer code. You are probably aware that functional languages are closer to math than the more popular imperative languages. They also offer more abstracting power. So a natural temptation would be to say: You must learn Haskell before the bounty of category theory becomes available to you. But that would imply that category theory has no application outside of functional programming and that&rsquo;s simply not true. So I will provide a lot of C++ examples. Granted, you&rsquo;ll have to overcome some ugly syntax, the patterns might not stand out from the background of verbosity, and you might be forced to do some copy and paste in lieu of higher abstraction, but that&rsquo;s just the lot of a C++ programmer.\nBut you&rsquo;re not off the hook as far as Haskell is concerned. You don&rsquo;t have to become a Haskell programmer, but you need it as a language for sketching and documenting ideas to be implemented in C++. That&rsquo;s exactly how I got started with Haskell. I found its terse syntax and powerful type system a great help in understanding and implementing C++ templates, data structures, and algorithms. But since I can&rsquo;t expect the readers to already know Haskell, I will introduce it slowly and explain everything as I go.\nIf you&rsquo;re an experienced programmer, you might be asking yourself: I&rsquo;ve been coding for so long without worrying about category theory or functional methods, so what&rsquo;s changed? Surely you can&rsquo;t help but notice that there&rsquo;s been a steady stream of new functional features invading imperative languages. Even Java, the bastion of object-oriented programming, let the lambdas in C++ has recently been evolving at a frantic pace &mdash; a new standard every few years &mdash; trying to catch up with the changing world. All this activity is in preparation for a disruptive change or, as we physicist call it, a phase transition. If you keep heating water, it will eventually start boiling. We are now in the position of a frog that must decide if it should continue swimming in increasingly hot water, or start looking for some alternatives.\n\nOne of the forces that are driving the big change is the multicore revolution. The prevailing programming paradigm, object oriented programming, doesn&rsquo;t buy you anything in the realm of concurrency and parallelism, and instead encourages dangerous and buggy design. Data hiding, the basic premise of object orientation, when combined with sharing and mutation, becomes a recipe for data races. The idea of combining a mutex with the data it protects is nice but, unfortunately, locks don&rsquo;t compose, and lock hiding makes deadlocks more likely and harder to debug.\nBut even in the absence of concurrency, the growing complexity of software systems is testing the limits of scalability of the imperative paradigm. To put it simply, side effects are getting out of hand. Granted, functions that have side effects are often convenient and easy to write. Their effects can in principle be encoded in their names and in the comments. A function called SetPassword or WriteFile is obviously mutating some state and generating side effects, and we are used to dealing with that. It&rsquo;s only when we st…",

    "text": "Hi, and thanks :slightly_smiling_face: Operon is heavily influenced by Camel and XQuery. I've been using Camel for 7 years. Haven't tested Camel-K yet, but the route-building logic seems to be the same. Operon has the same premise as Camel-K; get rid of all the boilerplate, and focus on what matters, i.e. into the routing the data.\n\nBasically Operon has similar concepts that Camel has for building flows, but the data processing is nearer to XQuery's capabilities, while trying to make it leaner and better suited for today's microservices.\n\nMy main pain point with Camel has been that transforming data has been too tedious. Operon can fix this for JSON-data: I (or someone else) could e.g. build camel-operon -component, i.e. Operon could be used from Camel routes to transform data (jsonpath simply isn't enough, and other scripting languages are too verbose). However, the goal is to be able to use Operon as a standalone service for both integrations and data transformations, whenever possible. For this purpose a bunch of components has to builded, and for this task I will definitely need as much help as possible.",

Operon has the same premise as Camel-K; get rid of all the boilerplate, and focus on what matters, i.e. into the routing the data.\n\nBasically Operon has similar concepts that Camel has for building flows, but the data processing is nearer to XQuery's capabilities, while trying to make it leaner and better suited for today's microservices.\n\nMy main pain point with Camel has been that transforming data has been too tedious. Operon can fix this for JSON-data: I (or someone else) could e.g. build camel-operon -component, i.e. Operon could be used from Camel routes to transform data (jsonpath simply isn't enough, and other scripting languages are too verbose). However, the goal is to be able to use Operon as a standalone service for both integrations and data transformations, whenever possible. For this purpose a bunch of components has to builded, and for this task I will definitely need as much help as possible."

My thoughts .... most programs are a mix of Calculation + Data Store + UI .... and it is a challenge to integrate these 3 in a seamless way. For example. no code/low code apps. Low code apps tend to be good at Data Store + UI but struggle with calculations. Often the calculations are unable to control the UI. They struggle integrate calculations into the UI and Data Store rules. ... So when I look at this, I can see you have done a good job of linking the Data Store and Calculations but I suspect the difficult use cases will be when you want to control the UI with the calculations, and also connecting the UI to the data store....   Hope this helps. I want to get better at explaining this, hope you can follow my thinking.",

My thoughts .... most programs are a mix of Calculation + Data Store + UI .... and it is a challenge to integrate these 3 in a seamless way. For example. no code/low code apps. Low code apps tend to be good at Data Store + UI but struggle with calculations. Often the calculations are unable to control the UI. They struggle integrate calculations into the UI and Data Store rules. ... So when I look at this, I can see you have done a good job of linking the Data Store and Calculations but I suspect the difficult use cases will be when you want to control the UI with the calculations, and also connecting the UI to the data store....   Hope this helps. I want to get better at explaining this, hope you can follow my thinking."

I am excited to get to know people here and work together!\n\nmotivation\n• I'm looking for a programming environment where I can go from an idea to an implementation as quickly as possible.\ndomain of interest\n• I am interested in tools which enable sophisticated end-users to build their own interfaces and functionality to manage their data and social networks, discover like-minded people and collaborate with them effectively.\n• I have a particular app/system I want to build — \"Network of trust\". It can solve the problem of fake accounts (my presentation: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZJ-BercOGg>) and also enables you to weigh opinions of different people by trustworthiness of these people derived from trust chains from you to this or that person in the corresponding competence area. (I see it as a solution to what Alan Kay once wrote about: \"the [information] retrieval systems of the future are not going to retrieve facts but points of view\" <https://vk.com/trustnet?w=wall-56630573_84_r91>)\nideal\n• I want the highest-level programming that is possible: I communicate to an IDE my intentions (goals, restrictions, preferences) and the IDE gives me a working version of a program satisfying these conditions, which I then can customize and try using, then update my intentions and go to the next iteration, etc.\nsome wishes\n• Functionality discovery right in the IDE, integrated with external sources (libraries, APIs). When I want to do something but yet do not know how to do it in this particular language, the IDE should be helpful to find that out (instead of googling manually). Ideally the solutions thus found should be already plugged-in and working with my actual data without the need for manually setting them up. E.g. when I want to plot a bar chart from my data, the IDE fetches several libraries that can do that (sorted by some ranking of relevancy and quality) and shows me the actual results of these options (with my actual data) so I can choose which I like more.\n• I can organize my code spatially (in 2D or even 3D). So that when I want to edit my program, I always know where to look for relevant parts of code to edit or add to.\n• Structured code editing, with the impossibility of syntax errors. Ability to select and edit whole semantic entities instead of just editing text characters. Convenient refactoring.\nprogramming experience\n• I learned a bit of Pharo Smalltalk, then made some projects with Javascript and Node.js (<https://hatsevich.ru/programming_portfolio.html>). Working in Pharo IDE was much more convenient then editing text files (javascript/node.js). Maybe I should return to it and use it for backend — unless you point me to something better.\nsome thoughts on programming I wrote earlier\n• \"Why programming languages are broken and how we can fix them\" <https://www.facebook.com/g.hatsevich/posts/742023955927813>\n• \"Tool-oriented programming\" <https://www.facebook.com/g.hatsevich/posts/741820789281463>\nInteresting links on the \"perfect programming\" topic I found I posted here: <https://vk.com/perfect_programming>",

I stumbled on this community while researching the current state of the art of node editors for implementing my Nth node/visual editor.  My holy grail is trifecta of performance by default, rich visualization/debugging, and adding a procedural/scripting layer to tools for artists. Currently to me, the solution to those goals converged to imperative  programming with a functional core, relational code architectures (e.g. in games ECS over OOP). I just discovered \"Language oriented design/projectional editors\" which seem to be the final missing piece so I'm excited to dive more",

I’m developing a DSL and development environment for transparent data processing, i.e. a language to build data warehouses and reports in a collaborative environment where both developers and domain experts can understand what the program does even in large systems. I’m interested in everything relating to this, e.g. data processing and visualizations, PL theory, Category theory, code editing, code management and more."

On top of that I simply got the haskell bug, I didn't know about functional programming (my programming experience consisted to that point of a Java course from university) and I found it to fit how I think really well.\n\nI have watched both of those Youtube channels, they are quite delightful."

Over the last couple years, I've been playing with a handful of flow-based programming tools and prototyping my own. My main interest is in tools that make programming more accessible to everyone, especially those without technical backgrounds. I believe that the flow paradigm is intuitive and flexible enough to become a mainstream interface that everyone can use to manage their data, devices, etc.\n\nI started working as a fullstack eng at <http://Parabola.io|Parabola.io> just a couple months ago. It's a web-based flow tool for connecting and processing data from a wide range of other cloud platforms. Think flow programming meets IFTTT meets Excel. It's been an interesting shift in mindset, going from daydreaming about a flowy future to building a product that needs to solve practical needs for users! :slightly_smiling_face: It's a fun challenge, and I hope to share a few insights in the future!\n\nHopefully you'll see me jump into some conversations around Slack and Twitter. And if you're playing with Parabola, I'd love to know what you think. Please reach out if you need a hand with anything (tech issues, feature requests, pricing, etc)",

        "text": "```\n# uCISC System and Hardware\n\nuCISC is designed to prefer lots of small micro processor cores over larger more powerful\ncores. In general, uCISC perfers to provide the software with predictable transparent access\nto the hardware and let the software decide how to use this and utilize the capabilities\noptimally.\n\nFor example, modern processors make heavy used of pipelining and superscaler architectures to\ntransform a sequential set of instructions into a parallel matrix of execution units. The\nprocessors do advanced fetch, decoding and planning logic to attempt to maximize the overall\nthroughput of the processor. Pipelines aren't terribly difficult to understand, but superlinear\nscaling is highly opaque to most programming work. Because of these design constraings,\nprocessors perform a lot of speculative execution that is hard to unwind during security faults.\nFurther, this leads to huge transistor counts. uCISC prefers to use additional transitors to add\nmore cores that can be software controlled effectively.\n\n### Processor Architecture\n\nThe basic processor structure is a hierarchical structure where each processor has a single\nparent (except the root processor) and up to 255 children processors. In order to access the\nprocessors, they must be \"banked\" in 4k blocks.\n\n#### Memory\n\n*Local Memory*\n\nThe processor has up to 64k words of 16-bits each for local memory. A page of memory is 256\nwords (512 bytes) and a block of memory is 4k words (8k bytes). The highest available memory\naddress is accessible in the device address space at address 0x1000.\n\n*Banked Memory*\n\nThe uCISC processor uses [bank switching](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_switching>) to\nprovide access to other processors. This works by mapping a specific block to a processor ID.\nOnce mapped, any reads or writes to this memory block will actually read or write from the\nspecified processor. The memory bank isn't actually directly connected to the local memory\nof another processor, but it is dependent on the other processor reading or writing the\nrequested data.\n\nBanked memory example:\n\n```\n# Setup: We have configured the 4k block at 0x1000 to point to processor ID 0 (our parent)\n# You do this by setting specific values in device space. We assume that is already done here.\n0/copy 16 into 2.reg/ 4.val 10.imm 2.reg\n212/swap MSB and LSB/ 2.reg 2.reg\n# 2.reg now points to 0x1000\n\n# Copy the value on the stack to our parent processor\n0/copy/ 1.mem/SP/ 2.mem\n\n# We can copy multiple words by using repeated instructions (see Instruction Behaviors)\n0/copy 0x10 to flags register and set repeat/ 4.val 10.imm 4.reg\n# Copying multiple words takes fewer instructions and may have a data width speed boost.\n# See Instruction Behaviors for more details on performance.\n0/copy 16 words to parent/ 1.mem 2.mem\n\n# Read return value from parent (1 word), push to stack\n# Copying multiple would work as well\n0/copy/ 2.mem/parent/ 1.mem 1.push\n```\n\nNote that writing to banked memory only works if the processor on the other side is reading,\nand reading only works if the other processor is writing. Reads and writes block until the\nother processor responds accordingly.\n\n```\n# Processor A has 0x1000 banked to ID = 0, 1.reg is SP, 2.reg is 0x1000\n# Write to parent, blocks until parent reads it\n0/copy/ 1.mem 2.mem/parent/\n... other instructions\n\n# Processor P (parent) has 0x4000 banked to ID = 4 (processor A), 1.reg is SP, 2.reg is 0x4000\n# Push value from child onto stack, blocks until child writes\n0/copy/ 2.mem 1.mem 1.push\n... other instructions\n```\n\nThis means a few things:\n\n* Since reads and writes are blocking, the code on the various processors need to coordinate\n* Device space includes the ability to determine which children processors are reading or\n  writing. The parent processor is responsible for coordinating the work for the children.\n* Since the the receiver is doing a copy from the banked memory to some other address, the\n  sender does not know the real address for where the data is coming from. The sender doesn't\n  know where the data is going to either. This is effectively an opaque security boundary\n  across which the processors are sending messages.\n* The parent knows exactly which process is sending it the message (the one that is banked).\n  The OS can establish a trust chain to precisely know what code is running where and what\n  code is making what system calls.\n* It is possible, depending on the hardware implementation, for processors to \"write through\"\n  to other processors including siblings or grandparents in one clock cycle. The intermediate\n  processors just need to be writing to/from different banked memory spaces and the hardware\n  write through timing needs to be fast enough to support it.\n\n*Accessing Device Space*\n\nBits 9 and 10 of the flags register control source and destination between devices space (1)\nand memory space (0). Note that the lowest 4k block of device space is missing, so the address\nrange from 0x0000 to 0x0FFF always addresses memory space whatever the bits are set to. When\naccessing memory space, the normal banking behavior applies.\n\nDevice space example:\n\n```\n0/copy/             4.val 2.imm 2.reg\n# Set 2.reg to 0x0200, this has a 1 in the \"From\" flag position for device space\n212/swap MSB, LSB/  2.reg 2.reg\n# Configure the flags register\n0/copy/             2.reg 4.reg\n\n# Set 2.reg to point to 0x1000\n0/copy 16 into 2.reg/ 4.val 10.imm 2.reg\n212/swap MSB and LSB/ 2.reg 2.reg\n# 2.reg now points to 0x1000\n\n# Let's assume 1.reg points to some address &lt;= 0x0FFF\n# Since this address is less than 4k, it always points to memory space\n0/copy maximum local memory address/ 2.mem 1.mem\n# We now have the maximum memory address in 1.mem\n\n# You could use this to init the stack pointer by storing it in the register instead\n0/copy maximum local memory address/ 2.mem 1.reg\n# Increment the stack pointer so that the first \"push\" decrements to the last available address\n20E/increment stack pointer/ 1.reg 1.reg\n\n# Use memory space again\n0/copy 0 into flags reg, turning off device space/ 4.val 0.imm 4.reg/flags reg/\n```\n\nYou can set the bits for \"from\" and \"to\" independently to control the read and write behavior.\n\nFlags register:\n\n* 0x0000 - read and write to memory space\n* 0x0100 - read from memory space and write to device space\n* 0x0200 - read from device space and write to memory space\n* 0x0300 - read and write to device space\n\n#### Hardware Specification\n\nIt is not necessary for all cores in a processor to have the same resources available. In fact,\nit is expected that they won't. See the section on multi-core structure below. Each processor will\nneed to be queried via device space to see what it has available, how much memory, how many devices\nand so on.\n\n##### Figure 1 - Processor Architecture\n```\n#                             Up to 60k\n#                             ####################\n#                             # 0x1000 .. 0x2FFF #\n#        #############        #------------------#\n#        #           #        # 0x2000 .. 0x3FFF #\n#        # Processor #====||  #------------------#\n#        #   Core    #====||  #        ...       #\n#        #           #    ||  #------------------#\n#        #############    ||  # 0xD000 .. 0xDFFF #\n#        Parent (ID = 0)  ||  #------------------#\n#                         ||  # 0xE000 .. 0xFFFF #\n#        #############    ||  ####################\n#        #           #    ||               || Device Space\n#        # Processor #================================================ 0x0000 (the void)\n#        #   Core    #    ||          ||      Memory Space      ||\n#        #           #    ||   Banked ||                        || Local\n#        #############   ############################  ####################\n#                        # 0x0000 .. 0x0FFF =&gt; 0xNN #  # 0x0000 .. 0x0FFF #\n#                        #--------------------------#  #------------------#\n#        Child 1         # 0x1000 .. 0x2FFF =&gt; 0xNN #  # 0x1000 .. 0x2FFF #\n#  …",

Suddenly it is CISC because the 4k of main memory and single core is basically a CISC setup where each instruction loads and stores from memory. However, given a 12k LUT ECP5 FPGA which can fit roughly 6 cores with up to 5k dedicated block RAM each, (30k mem total). In a microcontroller config where there is no main mem, is this still CISC? Add 16mb of main memory to that same processor, now we are RISC basically because the logic of how you program the thing has changed simply by adding main RAM. Scale up to desktop or server and you now have a very, very RISC like setup because you will end up decomposing problems in such a way that you treat the attached memory like thousands of registers that you load from main RAM.",

Suddenly it is CISC because the 4k of main memory and single core is basically a CISC setup where each instruction loads and stores from memory. However, given a 12k LUT ECP5 FPGA which can fit roughly 6 cores with up to 5k dedicated block RAM each, (30k mem total). In a microcontroller config where there is no main mem, is this still CISC? Add 16mb of main memory to that same processor, now we are RISC basically because the logic of how you program the thing has changed simply by adding main RAM. Scale up to desktop or server and you now have a very, very RISC like setup because you will end up decomposing problems in such a way that you treat the attached memory like thousands of registers that you load from main RAM."

        "text": "```\n## Design Goals\n\nWith a few exceptions, these design goals have mostly been around since the\nbeginning of my hobby to build a processor from scratch. However, as the endeavor\nbecame more serious and I learned more about retro computing, computer\narchitectures and the current state of hobby electronics, I have refined them a\ngreat deal.\n\nThe examples below are given in uCISC syntax since it is more readable than\nthe binary instruction format. See the [syntax chapter](/03_Syntax.md) for more\ndetails. If you want to read through here first, just not that the examples\nmake verbose use of inline comments which are between slashes:\n\n```\n# This is a line comment\n... /this is an inline comment/ ...\n# Comments are removed before compliation and have no bearing on the result\n```\n\n#### Maximum Micro\n\nThe instruction set should be as small as possible. Initially, the aim was\nan 8-bit architecture, but in the end, that was too limiting. I tried really\nhard for a long time to stay at 8-bits, but a number of issues cropped up.\n\n* The space for immediate values was too small, 16-bit uCISC only has space\n  for 6 signed bits as it is, so you can imagine trying to fit it in 8-bits.\n* I didn't want to compromise on constant space and time (see below) and allow\n  variable byte width instructions.\n* The 16-bit address space is the minimum I could imagine to be useful for even\n  a hobby computer (256 addresses in an 8-bit space seemed small to me). In the\n  end 16-bit address space and 16-bit instructions has huge hardware benefits\n  since addresses and instructions can fit in the same registers, bus width, etc.\n\nAll instructions, therefore, should be 16-bits wide including the immediate\nvalue. Variable instruction widths are not allowed.\n\n#### Memory Based System\n\nuCISC comes firmly down on the side of CISC and is opinionated that memory is\nthe primary thing being manipulated. Registers are used only because it makes\nthe instructions easier to implement in hardware in many respects. RISC\narchitectures aim to \"reduce\" the amount of work a processor does on each\ninstructions. The\n[Wikipedia article on RISC](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer>)\nputs it like this:\n\n&gt; A common misunderstanding of the phrase \"reduced instruction set computer\" is\n&gt; the mistaken idea that instructions are simply eliminated, resulting in a smaller\n&gt; set of instructions. In fact, over the years, RISC instruction sets have grown in\n&gt; size, and today many of them have a larger set of instructions than many CISC CPUs.\n&gt; Some RISC processors such as the PowerPC have instruction sets as large as the CISC\n&gt; IBM System/370, for example; conversely, the DEC PDP-8—clearly a CISC CPU because\n&gt; many of its instructions involve multiple memory accesses—has only 8 basic\n&gt; instructions and a few extended instructions.\n&gt;\n&gt; The term \"reduced\" in that phrase was intended to describe the fact that the amount\n&gt; of work any single instruction accomplishes is reduced—at most a single data memory\n&gt; cycle—compared to the \"complex instructions\" of CISC CPUs that may require dozens of\n&gt; data memory cycles in order to execute a single instruction. In particular, RISC\n&gt; processors typically have separate instructions for I/O and data processing.\n&gt;\n&gt; The term load/store architecture is sometimes preferred.\n\nIn other words, RISC based systems copy values to registers and manipulate them there,\nwhereas CISC usually more directly manipulates memory instead. uCISC typically does\nup to four memory accesses per instruction:\n\n* Read the instruction from the PC\n* Read the value at the source memory location\n* Read the value at the target memory location\n* Write the result value to the target memory location\n\nProcessors that implement the uCISC instruction set are required to do all of these in\nconstant time execution (see below) with only a few exceptions. The example\nimplementations do all of this in a single clock cycle. For details on how this works\nread the memory design documentation (coming soon).\n\n#### Maximum Value\n\nThe instruction set should pack as much value as possible in the limited space.\nThis means that clever tricks are used to get double use of instructions. Humans\nare clever beings that can wield powerful tools in creative ways. It makes the\nlearning curve a bit higher, but the payoff is big.\n\nFor example, uCISC doesn't have jump instructions. A copy or ALU instruction will\ndo just fine if the resulting value is stored in the program counter. You can do\nquite a lot by just varying the arguments.\n\n```\n# Do a relative jump by adding a displacement value to the program counter\n0/copy/ 0.reg/from pc/ Entry.disp/displacement to Entry label/ 0.reg/into pc/\n\n# Absolute jumps are also possible\n0/copy/ 4.imm/from immediate/ Entry.imm/absolute offset to Entry/ 0.reg/into pc/\n```\n\nAnother example of packing more value into less space is the \"halt\" instruction.\nSince copying the value to the PC to itself with no offset will result in an\ninfinite loop, this particular combindation is treated as the \"halt\" instruction.\nAs an added benifit of the instruction set setup, you actually get conditional\nhalts by manipulating the effect argument.\n\n```\n# All of these instructions look at the flags set by the last ALU operation.\n# So you do some math, comparisons, etc. and check the result.\n\n# halt instruction (3.eff/always store/ is inferred here)\n0/copy/ 0.reg/from pc/ 0.imm/zero offset/ 0.reg/into pc/\n\n# halt if zero\n0/copy/ 0.reg/from pc/ 0.imm/zero offset/ 0.reg/into pc/ 0.eff/if zero/\n\n# halt if NOT zero\n0/copy/ 0.reg/from pc/ 0.imm/zero offset/ 0.reg/into pc/ 1.eff/if not zero/\n\n# halt if positive\n0/copy/ 0.reg/from pc/ 0.imm/zero offset/ 0.reg/into pc/ 2.eff/if positive/\n```\n\n#### Constant Time Peformance\n\nAll instructions should execute in a consistent time on a processor. There are\na few cases where this is not possible (e.g. page to/from main memory), but\nthese should be rare. This implies consistent instruction size, roughly equivalent\ninstruction computation time, etc. A lot of effort has been made to make the\ninstructions have roughly the same flavor even across different types.\n\nFor example, ALU and Copy instructions feel roughly the same, even if there is\nsome variance in bit widths or semantics on a few arguments based on the context\nof a copy verses an ALU operion. Notably, ALU operations have no immediate value\ndue to space constraints.\n\n```\n# Jump relative instruction\n0/copy/ 0.reg/from pc/ 6.imm 0.reg/into pc/\n\n# Jump relative with ALU instead\n# First, store 6 into a register (r3 in this cas)\n0/copy/ 4.imm 6.imm/immediate value 6/ 7.reg/into r3/\n# Then, add r3 to PC\n20A/add/ 7.reg/r3/ 0.reg/to pc and store in pc/\n\n# Jump relative with ALU, this time with value off the stack\n# May be useful for longer jumps that won't fit in an immediate\n20A/add/ 1.mem/value on stack/ 0.reg/to pc and store in pc/\n```\n\nAchieving constant time performance also typically means there are very few forms\nof caching allowed since cache misses necessarily produce longer execution times.\n\nSome exceptions being considered:\n - Memory paging. Steps should be taken to ensure minimal variability in access,\n   but accessing any shared resource will involve contention.\n - Device access, which is implemented through memory paging mechanics.\n - Page locks. Locking/unlocking pages involves accessing a shared resource.\n\nNote: It is possible for a system to have page addresses that are any multiple of\n16-bits. In this case, software will have to be recompiled as stack and memory\noffsets will be different, but it doesn't fundamentally change the instruction set.\nRegardless, the hardware must still conform to the constant time execution, which\nimplies a wider memory lookahead in the processor internals.\n\n#### Easy to Implement in Hardware\n\nEasy to implement is such a vague measure. More or less this means it should be\nimplementable on an FPGA by a hobbyist. Since I am a electro…",

And/or is it to enable you to build the next step, the visual editor, on a good foundation that matches the visual way of representing the web app?\nIt is for both of these reasons. Purely functional code is _very_ declarative, and thus is much better suited to a visual representation. I also want a safer/simpler experience for developers. The final vision I have is very ambitious, and may not be feasible for me to achieve. In working towards that vision, as I am building the pieces required for it, those pieces should be _independently useful_ for others. If I am not successful at any given point of my journey towards the final vision, what I have built up until that point should still be a net win for me in the work that I am doing at the time.\n\n&gt; Also, what about solutions like Purescript? I am guessing you want to go with Javascript due to its popularity and how easy it is to use? That certainly makes sense, just wondering hm!\nI have considered compile-to-JS solutions, but I have issue with the community size, the ecosystem size, and the interop (they all promise 100% interop with JS on the box, but the reality is sometimes not so easy). Having said that, I'm likely to have the same challenges, there's more to interop than syntax, transpilation and module systems.\nMostly, though, the biggest concern I have is _inheritability_. I want a project that was created using my stack to be inheritable even to programmers that aren't necessarily familiar with FP. Although they may struggle to understand code they've inherited from me at first if they're not accustomed to FP, if that code is just a subset of JS, they can disable/remove the tooling that limits the code to a subset, and carry on with the project more easily using the paradigms that they are already familiar with.\nI think this is one of the big issues with low-/no-code tools atm, they're walled gardens: there's literally _no code_, users are just configuring an instance of the vendor's platform. I want to build something that is genuinely inheritable, not just on paper, but in a very practical sense. (there are also many other problems with no-code that I hope to tackle).\nIt is for this reason that the entire stack needs to be open source, and its pieces should strive to be independently useful. I aim to build communities around each piece so that there will be some measure of support for those that _do_ inherit from me.\n&gt; Btw. is there a way to follow your work, maybe somewhere to subscribe?

My main interest around the topic of this Slack is the idea of a cross-platform GUI library that would allow the implementation of apps that would work wonderfully on all 3 big operating systems.

In the case of a framework, you can do a rewrite that still re-uses a lot of the existing code. In the case of a no-code platform, you have to rewrite from scratch.\nThe problem is that success for a lot of projects doesn't necessarily mean that there is money for a team of professional developers to rewrite. Success might mean that a no-code app is heavily relied upon internally, but the company couldn't afford to rewrite it.\nNo-code tools generally solve the problem of writing the code. But that's often all they solve. Syntax is not the hard part of coding (after a few months). The hard part is keeping things well organised and adaptable.\nWhen a regular codebase gets out of hand, the code can be analysed and refactored with the help of tools. When a no-code app gets out of hand, :man-shrugging: .

If a developer writes code that adheres to the FP JS subset, I can generate a visual representation of it (the visual rep is just a projection of the AST, much like e.g. Prettier just projects the AST).\nThis would change no-code from a binary proposition (either yes or no), to a spectrum.\nCitizen devs can make most of the \"boring\" parts of the app, and call in a pro when they get stuck. The pro can use the interface she's used to (text). It won't be a choice between sticking with a no-code ball of mud, or an expensive complete rewrite by a team of devs. Each party can play to their strengths.\n\nIf its not inheritable, it represents a lot of risk to companies.

I care about the low levels not for performance optimization but to combat the complexity death-spiral all across the stack: <http://akkartik.name/akkartik-convivial-20200607.pdf>\n\nHere's my take on \"returning to native apps over web technologies\": the only reason we moved to web apps was that we polluted native apps for consumers with bloated installers, dark UX patterns (toolbars) and DLL hell. Now that story repeats on the web as well, so there's really nothing special about web apps. They seem more sandboxed, sure, but we've gradually put more and more valuable stuff inside the sandbox to the point that the outside often no longer matters (e.g. Chromebook). App stores seemed for a time to solve the problem, except not really (e.g. <https://twitter.com/jeremyburge/status/1275896482433040386>). The core problem is giving people the tools to add constraints on program behavior -- in a way that encourages them to grow more sophisticated in such program management. Any approach that expects consumers to just consume is doomed in the long run. This is the problem we need to solve, and the web has nothing to do with it.\n\nThe web is unsurpassed for documents and hyperlinks. Using it for other stuff is just fuzzy thinking.",

Now that story repeats on the web as well, so there's really nothing special about web apps. They seem more sandboxed, sure, but we've gradually put more and more valuable stuff inside the sandbox to the point that the outside often no longer matters (e.g. Chromebook).

From now on, I will be fully committed in exploring, experimenting, state-of-the-arting, discussing and, of course, building stuff in this very exiting field. I have some ideas to experiment, old prototypes to reconsider (and throw away again after picking the good parts), users to meet, existing tools and languages to explore, etc.\n \nHere are some quick words on the vision of what I would like to work on. At a very high level, it is all about tools for thought, tools to create, tools to share ideas, tools to program. More concretely, I plan to work on collaborative programming environments usable by non experts. With a focus on how to provide the more expressive/tangible/interactive/malleable views of programming artifacts. As first \"proglet\" representations, I am thinking to explore two well-known and successful visual ones: blocks à la Scratch and nodes'n wires à la Max/MSP. But with the ability to still use text languages when the visual ones are not appropriate (yet). As they are widespread and covers most of the technical needs, all this will first be based on web standards, which will also ease adoption and meet some common first usages. Another \"minor\" reason, is that I actually enjoy programming in JavaScript (and even more in Vue.js)! Ok, ok, I can hear half of you saying \"oh, nooo! not the web again\" and the other half saying \"obviously!\", while a third half (hopefully, the bigger of the three halves) doesn't understand those petty squabbles. :smile:\n \nMy background is nearly 30 years of professional programming on a wide range of fields (front/back/DB/infra/science/viz/GUI...), five years as an educator for creative computing with kids and adult beginners (mainly with Scratch) and a bit of programming for music/audio (with Live and MaxMSP) some times ago.\n \nOf course, I hope to be more active in this community (especially, compared to recently). I will be very happy to read and discuss all the very interesting subjects that you all are sharing here (some I have missed recently)!",

At a very high level, it is all about tools for thought, tools to create, tools to share ideas, tools to program. More concretely, I plan to work on collaborative programming environments usable by non experts. With a focus on how to provide the more expressive/tangible/interactive/malleable views of programming artifacts. As first \"proglet\" representations, I am thinking to explore two well-known and successful visual ones: blocks à la Scratch and nodes'n wires à la Max/MSP. But with the ability to still use text languages when the visual ones are not appropriate (yet). As they are widespread and covers most of the technical needs, all this will first be based on web standards, which will also ease adoption and meet some common first usages. Another \"minor\" reason, is that I actually enjoy programming in JavaScript (and even more in Vue.js)! Ok, ok, I can hear half of you saying \"oh, nooo! not the web again\" and the other half saying \"obviously!\", while a third half (hopefully, the bigger of the three halves) doesn't understand those petty squabbles.
