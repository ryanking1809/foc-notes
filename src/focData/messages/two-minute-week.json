So there seem to be two modes for consumption:\n\n* Who the heck are you? I can't spend more than 2 minutes on this shit at the moment.\n* I know who you are, and I'm choosing to slow down and imbibe. (Maybe I also want to backtrack, choose directions, ask questions? Maybe we need a new medium here. InfoQ is pretty decent with the video and slideshow separated. Can we make them tree-like?)\n\nThe presumption with 2-minute video is that if it doesn't hit, nobody's going to spend time trying to understand why.

Maybe we need a new medium here. InfoQ is pretty decent with the video and slideshow separated. Can we make them tree-like?)\n\nThe presumption with 2-minute video is that if it doesn't hit, nobody's going to spend time trying to understand why.

Certainly, for the graphical parts of coding, and that is a lot of the process, it will be much easier than typing. The key advantage of graphical interfaces is that you can constrain the visibility and presentation of options so that it is nearly impossible to have an invalid state. Textual coding has lots of tiny typographical errors, and that frustrates people. As i progress on this process of graphicalization i will find out how far you can actually take a language that is very Pythonic  into this space. The output of the IDE is the canonical text form of the language, which will allow programs last a lot longer. Different IDE's will spring up over time, and the internal form of a document from an IDE is highly IDE specific. Just for \"diff\" reasons you need a text form that can be compared and updated. So a graphical system that stores into text format is a very sound idea. I know that the Luna people are doing a similar thing. Anyway please let me know if the video is tolerable. It seems a little fuzzy; i uploaded it at 720p but maybe not enough pixels.\n\nThe IDE for Beads is written in itself, and shows very good compactness as it is only 15k words (approx 4000 lines) so far.",

A couple other observations:\n\n0:23, the \"result preview\" box content is centered, making it move unnecessarily during editing, keeping it aligned to the \"root\"/fixed point of the tree (eg. left for ltr, right for rtl, etc) would avoid that. Also, because its content is bright, it makes it even more attention-grabbing.\n\nAlt: instead of collapsing on write-pause, collapse on de-focus-up (eg. when selecting parent node) - this would make each animation \"expected\". Make each animation intentional: eg. 0:31 seems to do multiple things with the \"result box\"; the text changes color, and relative pos to box, and scales (what about treating it as one thing and just fading it away). Moments later, it pops back up again (debounce it?). At 0:32, the suggestion box moves back and fourth once, accident or intentional?\n\nAnyhow, neat project! Looking forward to see how it develops :slightly_smiling_face:",

A couple other observations:\n\n0:23, the \"result preview\" box content is centered, making it move unnecessarily during editing, keeping it aligned to the \"root\"/fixed point of the tree (eg. left for ltr, right for rtl, etc) would avoid that. Also, because its content is bright, it makes it even more attention-grabbing.\n\nAlt: instead of collapsing on write-pause, collapse on de-focus-up (eg. when selecting parent node) - this would make each animation \"expected\". Make each animation intentional: eg. 0:31 seems to do multiple things with the \"result box\"; the text changes color, and relative pos to box, and scales (what about treating it as one thing and just fading it away). Moments later, it pops back up again (debounce it?). At 0:32, the suggestion box moves back and fourth once, accident or intentional?\n\nAnyhow, neat project! Looking forward to see how it develops "

        "text": "Hey everyone. Recently I've read this article and really liked some plain ideas that seem to be unnoticed.  \n<https://programmingmadecomplicated.wordpress.com/2017/08/12/there-is-only-one-os-and-its-been-obsolete-for-decades/|https://programmingmadecomplicated.wordpress.com/2017/08/12/there-is-only-one-os-and-its-been-obsolete-for-decades/>\n\n&gt; Why do so many languages have a function called print instead of write or something else? They were influenced by C. Ever wonder why C called it so? Now you know. It literally printed ink onto paper.  \n&gt; ...  \n&gt; this is still the only way we can get anything done in the world of programming! Typing textual orders into a “terminal” or “console” application—nothing more than an emulator for the teletype!\n\nSo I got this feeling that there must be an API that would replace text pipes that we enjoy today in Unix world. Maybe this API is not discovered yet, but it definitely will be discovered sooner or later (just like lisp was discovered). What it should look like then?\n\n&gt; Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.\n\nCurrently I think about it on the level of the API, not on a transport level. I don't know will it use TCP or UDP sockets, or Unix pipes, or how it gonna be encoded, it unrelated for now.\n\nHere are my thoughts:\n\n1. Very simple API that is easy to implement on many platforms without mistakes.\n2. Convenient for providing access to complicated nested data between different programs.\n3. Convenient for inspecting remote object (say, interface for debugging).\n4. Don't demand any prerequisites for reading, filtering or transmitting. No prerequisite dependencies should be required: no grammar or types (unlike Protobuf or ASN.1).\n5. Suitable for delivering structured logs and events.\n\nSome related ideas to think about: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O8PwkXfDJg|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O8PwkXfDJg>  \nGraphQL also reminds something like that, but looks too complicated. Must be simpler.\n\nI've implemented something similar when I was working on complicated frontend code. A big tree of objects, to different parts of which you may subscribe and receive diffs. These diffs are accepted on other side and might be applied to get fresh information that we're interested in.\n\nThis idea of sending diffs for a tree which may be saved and applied at any moment in timeline is really beautiful. You got updates for your data and also the history of changes. It Very similar to VCS textual diffs, but for trees (AST ?).\n\n```\ndiff: { resource1: { status: started, startedAt: 1 } }\ndiff: { resource1: { status: stopped, stoppedAt: 2 } }\n----------\ntree: { resource1: { status: stopped, startedAt: 1, stoppedAt: 2 } }\n\n```\n\nSame trees might be used to deliver changes in AST during code editing.\n\nYet this API certainly gonna be used for delivering logs and events. Providing keys for each event is tiresome and requires to maintain state. So it must provide not only nested trees, but also sequences of objects.\n\n```\nseq: {event: \"app start\", at: 1}\nseq: {event: \"function-call start\", at: 2, funcName: \"foobar\", args: [1, 2]}\nseq: {event: \"app stop\", at: 5}\n\n```\n\nThen it came to me that this way we can integrate existing pipe-based outputs as sequences of binaries that are split by new line or by arbitrary size (say, size of the buffer).\n\nOne of the painful things when you deal with pipes is that everything is one-channel sequential. If you want to provide several kinds of data then you have to make interleaving, or create additional pipe.\n\nSo it came just natural that this API should be able to provide several channels of data, that allow you to filter out data you don't need. In these terms normal unix application provides two output channels: stdout and stderr. In this API you would be able to have many of them.\n\nHere are some questions to consider: should channels have type (tree or sequence)? Should we think about trees as sequence of diff objects, therefore just sequence? Or maybe allow every channel have sequence and tree under same name? This looks somewhat convenient with HTTP requests: having body as a sequence and headers and meta info as a tree.\n\nI can easily see this API being used for everyday problems with that sed, awk, grep used to solve. This API will naturally have some kind of shell environment (language?), position which held by bash in today world. An IDE where you observe flowing data, just like how you observe in now in DevTools in Chrome.\n\nBut that's really complicated issue, and I would love to hear feedback about written above first.",

    "text": "Here is a follow up on the Beads layout system. Beads has a very unique layout system that is slightly more advanced than the Apple struts and springs system used in XCode.  You design your layout by starting with the full screen rectangle, and subdividing it into pieces. Each chunk can be further subdivided. It has pre-programmed the commonly used types of decompositions: plain, vertical slice, horizontal slice, vertical scrolling, 2D grid, and a farily elaborate report writer for those who need to produce printed reports in the classic style. Since the layout system is in the language itself, you can use variables, IF statements, and subroutines in the layout portion, unlike CSS which hampers you great. Another huge advantage over CSS is that Beads uses explicit whitespace so placement of items is 100% predictable and repeatable, unlike CSS which on a small typo can scramble your page.  Building a complex product by gradual refinement is the methodology you use in Beads; always proceeding from a working standpoint, and adding in detail.   <https://youtu.be/lhLJbC7LA2k>",

                "text": "Here is a follow up on the Beads layout system. Beads has a very unique layout system that is slightly more advanced than the Apple struts and springs system used in XCode.  You design your layout by starting with the full screen rectangle, and subdividing it into pieces. Each chunk can be further subdivided. It has pre-programmed the commonly used types of decompositions: plain, vertical slice, horizontal slice, vertical scrolling, 2D grid, and a farily elaborate report writer for those who need to produce printed reports in the classic style. Since the layout system is in the language itself, you can use variables, IF statements, and subroutines in the layout portion, unlike CSS which hampers you great. Another huge advantage over CSS is that Beads uses explicit whitespace so placement of items is 100% predictable and repeatable, unlike CSS which on a small typo can scramble your page.  Building a complex product by gradual refinement is the methodology you use in Beads; always proceeding from a working standpoint, and adding in detail.   "

As is usually the case in such circumstances, I spent some time cleaning up code and refactoring - I often find such activities help keep the project momentum up, while requiring less time &amp; effort.\nI have spent some time recently thinking about how to manage note events and synchronize beats &amp; timing.  It seems like a good idea to integrate Ableton Link at the outset, because on some level it helps drive towards a cleaner management of such things.  It is also really nice to have a built in way for musicians to work together with a live coder; a USP perhaps.  I don't say it in the video, but the tempo of the audio is being controlled using the iPad drumming app, which the sample app and the synth are aligning with.\nAnother piece of ongoing work is the integration of Orca-c which I've shown previously.  This is an embedded Orca inside my text editor and forms one way in which a coder can drive the synthesizer (and later, I hope, some geometry/graphics too).  Orca isn't the only way I intend to generate music, but it represents a relatively easier integration than music languages, etc.  As I say in the video, there is still work to do to complete this feature.",

As is usually the case in such circumstances, I spent some time cleaning up code and refactoring - I often find such activities help keep the project momentum up, while requiring less time & effort.\nI have spent some time recently thinking about how to manage note events and synchronize beats & timing.  It seems like a good idea to integrate Ableton Link at the outset, because on some level it helps drive towards a cleaner management of such things.  It is also really nice to have a built in way for musicians to work together with a live coder; a USP perhaps.  I don't say it in the video, but the tempo of the audio is being controlled using the iPad drumming app, which the sample app and the synth are aligning with.\nAnother piece of ongoing work is the integration of Orca-c which I've shown previously.  This is an embedded Orca inside my text editor and forms one way in which a coder can drive the synthesizer (and later, I hope, some geometry/graphics too).  Orca isn't the only way I intend to generate music, but it represents a relatively easier integration than music languages, etc.  As I say in the video, there is still work to do to complete this feature."

First they look at their inputs, and if any of them are 'flow data' or 'control data', they are checked to see if they are current.  If not, the graph walks further up and evaluates until the node inputs are 'current'.  Then it can be computed.  So it's very much a 'pull' architecture.\nI have 3 basic types of 'pins' on my nodes.\n• Flow Data.  This is like a big bundle of data arrays.  The node is expected to work on all data streams it receives in each compute step.  For music, these arrays are typically buffers of audio data; often with 1 buffer per note of polyphony.  \n• Control Data. These are also bundles of arrays, but typically contain control information, such as modulation curves.  It is just convenient for me to separate the concept of control from data.\n• Parameters.  These are just data values such as float, int, etc.  They can be connected to other nodes, but they are not 'evaluated' to satisfy graph compute.  They are considered 'always valid', but that doesn't mean that the node won't walk back up the connection chain of the parameter to find the source value.\nIt should be considered prototype/research code, but you can see the graph Compute function here: <https://github.com/cmaughan/nodegraph/blob/master/src/model/graph.cpp>",

Orca does indeed schedule immediately, but those generated notes  are effectively played after a small delay when the arrive at whatever Synth you are using; you just don't notice.  It should be a similar situation here; and although I am testing far into the future, in reality I will probably be scheduling much more closely to 'now'.  I'm trying to plan a for a future containing a music generation language I've been working on, alongside Orca.   Although Orca is very fast, a music language may not be as fast.   I know, for example, that Sonic Pi has a delay of 250-&gt;500ms which is added to generated notes.   By scheduling a little bit into the future, there is I hope more time to generate and align notes correctly.  My sense is that i need this flexibility, but we will see.  Pattern languages also let you 'see' into the future, since you can run the pattern forward; so the concept of what is happening 'next' is something I want to at least be able to see.",

                "text": ", Indeed, I am scheduling into the future, but not much....  Orca does indeed schedule immediately, but those generated notes  are effectively played after a small delay when the arrive at whatever Synth you are using; you just don't notice.  It should be a similar situation here; and although I am testing far into the future, in reality I will probably be scheduling much more closely to 'now'.  I'm trying to plan a for a future containing a music generation language I've been working on, alongside Orca.   Although Orca is very fast, a music language may not be as fast.   I know, for example, that Sonic Pi has a delay of 250->500ms which is added to generated notes.   By scheduling a little bit into the future, there is I hope more time to generate and align notes correctly.  My sense is that i need this flexibility, but we will see.  Pattern languages also let you 'see' into the future, since you can run the pattern forward; so the concept of what is happening 'next' is something I want to at least be able to see."

Firstly, I’ve been working on a presentation about what problem Glance is attempting to solve, why that problem is worth solving, and it proposes a plan for how we can attempt to solve it. I plan to share this presentation within the next day or two. The second thing is that I have started investigating how to make a GUI for Glance, by which I mean a visual programming editor that will generate Haskell. Right now I’m evaluating the GUI toolkit GTK because it has Haskell bindings. The existing Glance code creates diagrams using the Haskell diagrams library, and I should be able to render these diagrams in GTK using the Cairo or GTK backends for the diagrams library.\n<https://youtu.be/dU0rHwNXCig>",

I have a prototype that involves a linked list of timeline events, allocated from a memory pool which is thread safe.  It seems to work OK, but it is ongoing research.\n• Bugs!  I had a significant bug with the 'widen' button on the master output.  That just adds a small delay to the right stereo channel.  Every time I turned it on I would get audio corruption.  I eventually realized that this was caused by the spectrum analyzer(!) which was reading the graph 'too early' and breaking the 'history' buffer of the delay module.  As I also mention in the video, I have an audio glitch which could be one of several things, but is most likely caused by the new effect modules. \nHopefully this week I'll find time to get to the bottom of the audio problem and try to add a LFO to add more interesting sound effects.  Now I have a large palette of units, I also want to try writing some 'ugens' to make synthesizer graphs.\nThe current graph layout matches a synthesizer I have for my iPad, as I've mentioned before - Audio Kit Synth One.  This is great because I can try to reproduce sound effects from that synth; but I want to move on from that and create my own layouts - since at the heart of this design is the idea that live coders can build synthesizers to match what they want to create and tweak them 'live'",

It's fairly unambitious as a language; all the attention has gone to bootstrapping the implementation out of machine code.\n\nBut your concrete question is quite acute. \"What happens if you've used a field that doesn't appear in the type definition?\" I hadn't thought of it yet when I made the video. It only occurred to me in the past week. I now raise an error if a type definition failed to reconcile some field from earlier. But it's a fairly klunky error message; it just says, \"you used field `x` but it doesn't exist.\" It can't give the line or even function that used `x`. Providing such errors is going to complicate the implementation quite a bit, needing to attach source info to uses of fields in types. But I _did_ stake out a position in my paper as being all about the quality of error messages. This whole thing is now making me quite unhappy.

(And function overloading, and generics, none of which are in the current prototype.) I hadn't connected the dots to think of this as a particularly Literate feature. That might be a good justification to take it out. Thanks!\n\n_The reason Mu doesn't have LP anymore_: I was fine encouraging hunks to refer to local variables that were in the same scope but far away in some other part of the description. However, the way Mu now exposes and requires using registers, hunks can now _destroy_ local variables far away in the same scope (that happen to share the same register). That feels too mind-bending.\n\nThen again, maybe I should allow _shadowing_. So you can't insert naked statements using Literate directives, only blocks. Hmm, that could work. (If I can get the error messages good enough.) Thanks!",

        "text": "```\n# Code Paradise\n\nCode Paradise is the name of my current pet project. Code Paradise is going to be a [web based](#web-based) [platform](#platform) for [kids](#kids) to learn to program using Object Oriented principles in [Smalltalk](#Smalltalk). It is a place to go when initial experience has been gathered on HTML and CSS and/or environments like [Scratch](<https://scratch.mit.edu>) and [Blockly](<https://developers.google.com/blockly/>).\n\n## Status\n\nCode Paradise is still in very early stages of development. Progress is limited because the development has to be done in the evenings and weekends. And even that is limited because of having a family and a regular social live. Development is still a one man show. The plan is to attract kids to join in at an early stage, so they can help shape the environment.\n\n## &lt;a name=\"platform\"&gt;Why a platform?&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCode Paradise is going to be a platform for kids to share their work and help each other. Mentors (experienced developers and/or teachers) are allowed on the platform as well.\n\n## &lt;a name=\"kids\"&gt;Why kids?&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSimply put, kids are the future programmers and I like to offer another platform next to the existing ones. One based on the principles of [Object Orientation](<http://www.purl.org/stefan_ram/pub/doc_kay_oop_en>) (Alan Kay's explanation). I have a broad range of experience with different programming languages and development environments and have personally been most happy with programming using [Smalltalk](#Smalltalk) (in different environments). I want to share that type of happiness with our future programmers.\n\nStrictly speaking the platform is not going to be restricted to kids. Anyone wanting to learn programming can join. Tone of voice, examples and explanation might be more focused on kids than (young) adults though.\n\n## &lt;a name=\"Smalltalk\"&gt;Why Smalltalk?&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAs explained above, using Smalltalk for programming does and did make me very happy (as a programmer). Two elements stand out for me: the simplicity of the underlying model (communicating objects using messages) and a live moldable environment (direct changes and changing the development environment itself). Both are [design principles of Smalltalk](<http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/smalltalk.html>). Different Smalltalk implementations do exist, all with their own focus. Two have my special attention [Pharo](<https://www.pharo.org>) and [Cuis](<https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/Cuis-Smalltalk-Dev>). The former has a very active community and is very feature rich. The latter is focused on a clean and simple implementation which is nice for learning purposes. Additionally a [toolkit Glamorous](<https://gtoolkit.com>) is built on top of Pharo that really shows the possibilities of moldability.\n\n## &lt;a name=\"web-based\"&gt;Why web based?&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe platform is going to be web based, because this lowers the barriers for using it. Anyone with a (relative recent) web browser on his/her computer should be able to use the platform.\n\n## &lt;a name=\"implementation\"&gt;How will the platform be implemented?&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe platform will consist of a server farm running many Smalltalk images. At this time it is not decided if this will be limited to a specific Smalltalk implementation or if different implementations will co-exist. The latter would mean that these differences has to be made clear to the users, which does not help in the understandability of the platform. All code will become open source and schools, other organizations or individuals should be able to setup their own server/platform as well.\n\n(the following text needs to be cleaned up)\n\n## Background UI\n\nThe development environment itself will be running on the mentioned servers. The web browser is only responsible for the user interface of the development environment. A small Smalltalk application will run (as a kind of Javascript replacement) in the web browser to handle user interface logic (displaying information and receiving input events). All decision logic (even of what should be displayed) is performed on the server side.\n\n[SqueakJS](<https://squeak.js.org>) or [Amber](<https://amber-lang.net>) can already be used as Smalltalk development environment in the web browser. They both would require quite some work to become a team environment in which users can help each other and an environment that could use more (server side) resources like databases. Running a 'regular' Smalltalk image inside SqueakJS does work, but requires a fast CPU and a lot of memory. Amber's main focus is on client side development. It could be used for the user interface, but it would use a very distinct implementation since it is not based on a Smalltalk image being run by a VM.\n\nThe current plan is to have a web browser as the 'head' of the development environment. It should only represent the display and input device. There has to be some logic in the web browser to create the display (creating elements in the DOM) and handling events (user pressing buttons or dragging windows). This is normally done in Javascript, but kids should not learn Javascript as well. Although some solutions do exist to have Smalltalk in the browser, the Javascript often shines through. As soon as an event is not handled correctly, Javascript will generate an exception. This does not fit the Smalltalk model and some translation has to be done between the two models. [PharoJS](<https://pharojs.github.io>) might be useful option here as well as SqueakJS, but both focus on a different use case.\n\nCurrently work is being based on a [tiny Smalltalk image](<https://github.com/carolahp/pharo/tree/candle>) running on SqueakJS (a Smalltalk VM written in Javascript) in the browser. This tiny image is responsible for the client side UI logic. The server side Smalltalk image contains UI components (classes) which 'know' their HTML and CSS (something kids do learn in different places) and a bit of Smalltalk code to handle events. This UI component (HTML, CSS and code) is transferred to the web browser and installed in the tiny image. It will create the same UI component (class) inside the browser and it can/will only do the displaying and event handling. If the server side code changes, these changes are sent to the web browser as well. This keeps the UI components in sync. If an exception occurs in the tiny image, it will be send back to the server as an event. The server can handle it or show a debugger (which of course gets displayed in the web browser just like everything else). There has to be a tiny glue layer between the tiny image and the DOM. This is done by a Javascript plugin for SqueakJS (and could be regarded as part of the VM) like UI handling for desktop Smalltalks is also handled in plugins. \n\nThe tiny image will receive classes and methods in bytecode format. Execution of code is initiated by the development environment. This way no Compiler is needed in the tiny image. A working prototype of this mechanism (running in the browser) has been development and seems to perform well. The tiny image is around 150kb at the moment, but a number of features need to be added.\n\nThe UI components are based on the [Web Components](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components>) standard.\n\n## Background applications\n\nFor the application development at least two Smalltalk images are used. One image will contain the development environment (the one mentioned in the previous paragraph) and the others will run the applications under development. These applications themselves will be tiny images similar to the image for the UI described above. That way it is easy to create a new (or throw away an old) application, but still keep the development environment. The application itself will also not require a Compiler since all code will be installed in bytecode format from the development image (similar again to the way the UI image is provisioned). The tiny image make…",

This issue is intended to track the pros and cons.\n\nPrevious discussion: <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21268252#21293301|https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21268252#21293301>\n\nInitial list of pros and cons:\n\n• Pro: names give some indication (albeit imprecise) of the operation being performed.\n• Pro: names can be checked by tooling. Typoing `8d` for `8f` seems easier than typoing `copy` for `pop`.\n• Con: per-opcode mnemonics are an additional set of things for the new reader to understand and navigate. And cross-correlate with the Intel manual, since it only gives names to sets of opcodes.\n• Con: tooling may have a hard time giving a good error message when a user typos one variant of say `add` for another.",
